00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:04,890
欢迎回来，现在是凝聚态课程的第十七讲
welcome back this is now the seventeenth
lecture of the condensed matter course

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,150
当我们上次离开时​​，我们谈论的是乐队的结构， 
when we left off last time we were
talking about band structure and we were

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,330
讨论导带，空穴和价带中的电子，以及
talking about electrons in conduction
bands and holes and valence bands and

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,700
今天我们要做的是，首先要考虑如何
what we're going to do today is we're
going to start by thinking about how

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,039
电子和导带以及价带中的空穴四处移动，所以让我们
electrons and conduction bands and holes
in valence bands move around so let's

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,390
首先画一个导带的底部，所以我们有一些E和
start by drawing the bottom of a
conduction band so we have some E and

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,820
一些K，并且导带将会有一些二次最小值
some K and there's going to be some
quadratic minimum of a conduction band

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,270
让我们称此点为发生底部的位置
let's call this point here came in where
the bottom occurs and this point here

9
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,110
我们将其称为不是导带底部的能量
we'll call it e not the energy of the
bottom of the conduction band very

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,059
通常，也许我会在这里写出来，我们可以写
generally maybe I'll write it over here
very generally we can we can write for

11
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,410
在带的底部附近的电子，E大约为e 
an electron in the near the bottom of
the band that E is approximately e

12
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:58,789
零加泰勒展开式d平方e DK平方乘以K减去K min 
nought plus just the Taylor expansion d
squared e DK squared times K minus K min

13
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:05,430
平方其他术语，我们将忽略，鉴于此，我们将定义一个
squared maybe other terms which we'll
ignore and given this we will define an

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:15,320
有效质量电子有效质量电子有效质量有效
effective mass an electron effective
mass electron effective mass effective

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:27,390
质量M star通过m星电子上的1等于H bar上的1 
mass M star I'm star sub electron via 1
over m star electron equals 1 over H bar

16
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:37,979
平方d平方e DK平方使得没有能量加通常的H 
squared d squared e DK squared such that
the energy is e naught plus the usual H

17
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:46,920
 bar平方K减去K min平方2m电子星，现在看起来非常
bar squared K minus K min squared over
2m electron star now this looks very

18
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,000
就像自由电子一样，除了动量之外，波矢应该是
much like a free electron except the
momentum the the wave vector should be

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,799
相对于它们的测量，通常动量的最小值
measured with respect to them wherever
the minimum in the momentum is the usual

20
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,560
现在给定自由电子抛物线，我们还可以计算实际给定的任何
free electron parabola now given this we
can also calculate actually given any

21
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:08,250
在这个频带中，电子的能量形式
form of the energy of the of the
electron in this in this band we can

22
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,030
一般写组速度v组
write a group velocity v group very
generally is deal

23
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,400
衰减是群速度的一般表达，因为我们可以重放欧米茄
decay that's a general expression for a
group velocity since we can replay Omega

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,260
超过H bar倍乘以能源DK的倍数，这就是一般关系
by 1 over H bar times times and energy
de DK this is the general relationship

25
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,790
在我们的情况下，对于一个带中电子的群速度，将使用
for the group velocity of an electron in
a band in our case it will be using this

26
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:41,140
在这里的弥散度将是H Bar K减去电子m星上的K min 
dispersion up here it will be H Bar K
minus K min over m star of the electron

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:46,209
因此，这意味着如果您将图片移到这里
so it means that if you have this
picture over here if you if you move the

28
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,709
电子在最小值的右边，然后电子在右边移动
electron to the right of the minimum
then the electron is moving to the right

29
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:54,670
如果将电子移至最小值的左侧，则电子正在移动
if you move the electron to the left of
the minimum then the electron is moving

30
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,209
左边是事实，与青铜器中最小的位置无关
to the left this is true independent of
where in the bronz own the minimum

31
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,530
发生，所以真正的问题是您相对于
occurs so really the issue is where are
your position with respect to the

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,160
如果要弄清楚小组速度现在是哪个方向，则为最小值
minimum if you want to figure out which
direction your group velocity is now

33
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:15,310
有一些注意事项，在此不写
there are a couple of caveats they don't
write them here caveats one generally

34
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,680
有效质量是正确的这个质量可能是各向异性质量
effective mass is right this mass is
maybe anisotropic masses can be

35
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:32,200
各向异性意味着能量可能在所有方向上都是抛物线形的
anisotropic meaning that the energy is
it may be parabolic in all directions

36
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,370
但是取决于您选择曲率的方向是
but depending on which crystal direction
you choose the curvature may be

37
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,820
不同的是，如果您有四角形，这是很自然的
different this is sort of natural if you
have something like a tetra angle

38
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:43,030
水晶，在不同的方向上，轴的长度不同
crystal where the axes are different
lengths in the different directions you

39
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,980
可能期望在不同位移K中的能量曲率
might expect that the curvature of the
energy in the different displacing K in

40
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:52,090
不同的方向可能会有所不同，的确如此
the different directions might be
different and indeed it often is so one

41
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,730
不得不担心这样一个事实，取决于您走的是哪种方式
has to worry about the fact that
depending on which way you're going your

42
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,250
有效质量似乎有所不同，我们通常会忽略这一点，因此请忽略
effective mass may seem different we're
going to ignore this generally so ignore

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:05,470
这种并发症，但更普遍的是，您应该知道它确实会发生
this complication but more generally you
should be aware that it does occur the

44
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,390
您应该知道的第二种并发症是，您可以
second complication that you should be
aware and it occurs is you can have

45
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,870
如果在两个极小值的情况下绘制E对K的情况
situations if you plot E versus K in a
situation where there are two minima

46
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:22,660
以完全相同的能量发生
that occur at exactly the same energy
this e

47
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,740
这样导带的最小值可以出现在
so that the minimum of the conduction
band can occur at two places in the

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:36,940
青铜拥有k1和k2，由于明显的原因，它们被称为山谷
bronz own k1 and k2 these are known as
valleys valleys for obvious reason and

49
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,840
这看起来好像不是很不寻常的事情
this may look like it's not something
that's very unusual to have happen that

50
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,250
你只是一个巧合，以至于发生相同能量的最小值
you have just such a coincidence that
the minima that the same energy occurs

51
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,340
在青铜器中至少有两个地方，但实际上
at the minimum in two places in the
bronz own but in fact it's actually

52
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,810
由于晶体的对称性，因此很常见
quite common to have this be due to
symmetries of the crystal so generally

53
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,500
如果晶体特别对称，则会发生这种情况，您将拥有两个
this will happen if the crystal is
particularly symmetric you'll have two

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,890
铜带本身或两个不同点的导带中的最小值
minimum in the conduction band at two
different points in the bronz own or

55
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:04,150
甚至青铜拥有四个不同点甚至六个不同点
even four different points or even six
different points of the bronze own so

56
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,720
您必须跟踪电子是否在此最小值或以下
you have to keep track of whether the
electron is in this minimum or this

57
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,740
最低要求，但一般规则适用，如果您将自己从
minimum but the general rule applies
that if you displace yourself from the

58
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,860
如果移至最小，则向右移动
minimum to the right you're moving to
the right if you displace yourself from

59
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,160
在最小值的左边减去两个最小值，然后向左移动
two the minimum to the left of the
minimum then you're moving to the left

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,120
好吧，现在最后一点我们通常是
okay
now the final point generally we're

61
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,210
实际上，我们将忽略这种复杂性，也忽略这种复杂性
actually we're going to ignore this
complication also ignore this as well

62
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,930
请注意，有时会发生最终的并发症
just be aware that it sometimes occurs
the final complication is perhaps a much

63
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,760
更重要的并发症是如果您具有能带结构，这是青铜色
more important complication if you have
a band structure here's a bronze own if

64
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,840
您具有像我们之前绘制的紧密结合带结构那样的带结构
you have a band structure like the tight
binding band structures we drew before

65
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,910
看起来像这样，通常有效质量是由第二个给定的
that looks like this the generally the
effective mass is given by the second

66
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,710
能量相对于K的导数，因此将意味着
derivative of the energy with respect to
K so that would mean that M star of the

67
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:57,790
这里的电子大于零，但是在这里电子的M星将是
electron here is greater than zero but
up here M star of the electron would be

68
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:05,500
小于零，对于粒子具有负质量似乎很奇怪，但是
less than zero which seems rather odd to
have a negative mass for a particle but

69
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,710
我们稍后会看到这实际上很有道理，而实际上我们
we'll see in a moment that actually
makes quite a bit of sense and really we

70
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,180
应该认为电子的质量是负数
should think of the mass of the electron
as being negative the general definition

71
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,920
电子的质量超过H bar平方d平方e DK平方
that the mass of the electron one over H
bar squared d squared e DK squared will

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,210
始终保持不变，这就是我们应该一直认为的有效质量
always hold and that's what we should
always think of as the effective mass

73
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,220
好，到目前为止，这很好，这是容易的部分，困难的部分是当我们开始时
okay so far so good this was the easy
part the hard part is when we start

74
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:32,080
考虑价带顶部的孔
thinking about holes at the top of a
valence band

75
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,720
所以变得困难的原因是-迹象会回来咬你
so the reason it gets hard is because -
signs will come back and bite you one

76
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,289
或其他方式，因此很难跟踪减号并
way or the other so it's really hard to
keep track of the minus signs and to

77
00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,270
更糟糕的是，有些书将减号放在不同的位置，所以您
make matters worse some books put the
minus signs in different places so you

78
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,759
知道这是这些情况之一，只要您知道自己在做什么
know this is one of these situations
where as long as you know what you're

79
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,449
如果您有减号的偶数，则可以移动减号
doing you can move the minus sign around
if you have the even number of minus

80
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,949
一天结束时，您会得到正确的答案，但是我要做什么
signs at the end of the day you've got
the right answer but what I'm going to

81
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,669
告诉你我所认为的最自然的方法来思考放置位置
tell you is what I think is the most
natural way to think of where you put

82
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:04,870
减号，我认为大多数书籍对此都表示同意，但并非全部如此
the minus signs and I think most books
agree with me on this but not all so be

83
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,699
警告说，这是顶部有孔的情况
warned about that so this is the
situation with holes at the top of

84
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:19,780
价带处于乐队顶部，所以这意味着在这里我们发现了这个奇数
valence bands top of bands so so that
means up here where we found this odd

85
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:23,830
当我们考虑电子时，电子的质量为负
result that the mass of the electron is
negative when we're thinking about the

86
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,150
像在那边这样的乐队的顶部，我们通常会发现这个奇怪的结果
top of a band like over there where we
found this odd result we're usually

87
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,930
当我们在乐队的顶部时，想着一个几乎充满的乐队， 
thinking when we're at the top of the
band about a nearly filled band and

88
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,469
价带几乎满了，所以我们将再次绘制E与K，我们会想象
nearly filled valence band so we'll draw
again E versus K and we'll imagine that

89
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:43,840
我们有一些乐队的顶部，这些乐队大部分都充满了，我们会考虑的
we have the top of some band which is
mostly filled and we'll think about okay

90
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,630
我们将其放置在K Max上，好吧，我们将其称为e v-不在这里，我们
we'll put this at K Max and okay and we
will call this e v-not also up here we

91
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,520
想像一下，如果我们将电子放在该能带的顶部，那是一种能量
imagine if we put an electron up at the
top of this band somewhere it's a energy

92
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,610
会没事的，所以对于孔的情况，带子顶部带子顶部的能量
is going to be okay so for the case of
holes top a band top a band the energy

93
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:13,509
保持电子的追踪非常好
of an electron e electron it's really
good to keep keeping your head track of

94
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:17,349
不管是在谈论电子能量还是空穴能量，因为
whether you're talking about an electron
energy or a hole energy because you'll

95
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,580
看到他们将在一秒钟内变得困惑，所以电子能量如果
see that they're going to get confused
in a second so the electron energy if

96
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:27,940
您将电子放在频带的顶部附近，这将是一些容易的行加1/2 
you put an electron near the top of the
band that will be some easy row plus 1/2

97
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,078
 d平方e DK平方乘以K减去K max平方与它完全相同
d squared e DK squared times K minus K
max squared exactly the same way as it

98
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:39,098
以前是，但现在这里的数量为负，因此小于零， 

99
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,169
这就是为什么我们应该认为这里的电子质量是负数
this is why we should think of the mass
of the electron here as being a negative

100
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,950
数量，因为当您远离
quantity because the
goes down as you go away from the

101
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,310
最大，所以在这里我们要做的是使我们的生活更简单一些
maximum so here what we're going to do
to make our life a little bit simpler is

102
00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:09,360
定义孔的质量将孔的质量定义为整个m的H bar平方
to define a mass of a hole define mass
of hole to be H bar squared over m whole

103
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:18,250
恒星为负d平方e为电子DK平方，所以这东西在这里
star is minus d squared e for the
electron DK squared so this thing here

104
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:27,550
大于零在乐队的顶部乐队，你会注意到
is greater than zero at top a band
top of band and you will notice from

105
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,370
将此定义与上面的定义（孔的M星）进行比较
comparing this definition to the above
definition that the M star of the hole

106
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:42,550
实际上等于负号，电子的恒星还可以，所以在这里
is actually equal to minus and the star
of the electron okay so up here where

107
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:45,910
电子的质量似乎为负，我们已经定义了
the mass of the electron appears to be
negative we've defined the mass of the

108
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:50,860
现在是负号，为什么这样做才有意义，为什么我们
hole to be minus of that now why is it
that this makes sense to do why is it we

109
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,760
应该将孔的质量定义为电子质量的负数，并且
should define the mass of a hole to be
negative of the mass of the electron and

110
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:59,620
为什么它应该是孔的一部分在化合价的顶部为正
why would should it be part of the hole
be positive at the top of the valence

111
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,970
乐队，让我们考虑一下，所以在这里我们有相同的顶部
band so let's think about this for a
second so here we have the same top of

112
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,590
价带我们想象整个价带被填充，除了一个
the valence band we imagine the whole
valence band is filled except for one

113
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,960
我们将其放在乐队顶部的孔
hole which we're putting at the top of
the band here

114
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:21,430
好吧，所以孔的能量是恒定的，你不会在旋转
okay so the energy of the hole e hole be
some constant you're not twiddle and

115
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:25,570
那么我们想找出随着我们
then we want to find out how does the
energy of this hole change as we

116
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:30,790
将其从乐队的顶部移开，所以让我们在这里想象这一点
displace it from the top of the band so
let's imagine this point here just so we

117
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:35,500
不必随身携带这些K Max，再来吧，让我们决定一下
don't have to carry around these K Max's
and came ins anymore let's decide this

118
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,690
这里的点是K等于零，因为我们将K替换为
point here is K equals zero as we
displace K from this is just for

119
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:43,890
简单起见，它不一定是K等于零，但让我们想象一下它是
simplicity it doesn't have to be a K
equals zero but let's imagine it is

120
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,930
让我们问一下，当您从顶部移开孔时，能量会发生什么变化
let's ask what happens to the energy as
you displace the hole from the top of

121
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:54,850
乐队，所以当您这样做时，我们将把孔从这里移到这里
the band so we're going to move the hole
from here to here well when you do that

122
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,510
能量实际上从此上升了
the energy actually has gone up from
this

123
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,260
将整个乐队放在乐队的顶端为什么将其写成H条
placing the whole from the top of the
band why is that well write it as H bar

124
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:08,200
我一直都在平方M星，如果我们从
squared to M star whole times I guess K
squared here if we're displacing it from

125
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,580
 K等于零是当我们置换整体时能量上升的原因
K equals zero the reason that the energy
has gone up when we displace the whole

126
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,170
从带的顶部开始是因为电子正试图到达最低的
from the top of the band is because the
electrons are trying to go to the lowest

127
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,910
可能的能量孔试图冒出最大的能量
energy possible the holes try to bubble
up to the highest energy possible it's

128
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:27,310
就像是一个气袋或气泡，或者像在水下推气球一样
like it's like an air pocket or a bubble
or like pushing a balloon underwater if

129
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,570
你把这个气球带到这里，然后把它推到水下，这花了你很多的精力
you take this balloon here and you push
it underwater that costs you energy it

130
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,410
花了你正能量去把这个洞推到下面
costs you positive energy to take this
hole and push it underneath the

131
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:38,710
电子，因为电子想要尽可能降低能量是
electrons because the electrons want to
go to the lowest energy possible is that

132
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:42,790
很明显，这就是直觉，为什么你应该考虑
clear that's the intuition why it is
that you should think of the mass of the

133
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,720
孔是正的，因为当您将其从乐队的顶部移开时
hole as being positive because when you
displace it from the top of the band it

134
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,510
花费你积极的精力远离乐队的顶峰
costs you positive energy to move away
from the top of the band so far so good

135
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:58,210
好的，好的，所以这是易于跟踪的迹象，但迹象越来越多
okay good all right so that's the easy
sign to keep track of but signs get more

136
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:07,500
复杂的让我们问一个孔的动量什么是孔的动量
complicated let's ask about the momentum
of a hole what is the momentum of a hole

137
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:17,590
一个洞的动量和一个思考这个问题的好方法是意识到
momentum of a hole and a good way to
think about this is to realize that a

138
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:27,160
填充带填充带没有动量没有晶体动量没有晶体
filled band filled band has no momentum
has no crystal momentum no crystal

139
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:37,840
动量没有电流惰性，根本没有晶体动量，所以如果我们想
momentum carry no current inert has no
crystal momentum at all so if we want to

140
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,960
知道乐队顶部的一个洞的动量是多少，让我们想象一下
know what the momentum is of a hole in
the top of the band let's imagine here's

141
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:49,060
我们的乐队除了一个状态是
our band we fill the entire band like
this except for one state which is

142
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,310
像这样的状态从AK失踪了我们想像这个洞
missing out of AK a state like this we
imagine taking this hole this missing

143
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:59,440
乐队中的粒子，如果我们将其添加到一个空的乐队中
particle from the band if we add it to a
band that's empty except for that one

144
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:06,210
电子放置在这个加号等于填充带等于填充带
electron placed in then this Plus this
equals a filled band equals filled band

145
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:13,030
填充文件填充带，所以动量等于总动量
filled file filled band
so momentum so total momentum equals

146
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:21,160
零总h-bar K等于零好吧，所以这两个的总和
zero total h-bar K equals zero okay so
the sum of these two put together the

147
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:25,780
无孔的填充带，再加上空带
filled band with the absence of the hole
plus the empty band with this one

148
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,190
电子对不起已满的供应商，缺少该电子再加上空的电子
electron sorry the filled vendor the
absence of this electron plus the empty

149
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,920
当您将它们的总和放在一起时，带存在这个电子
band with the presence of this electron
when you put them together their total

150
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:41,170
动量将为零，所以我们有h-bar K 
momentum is going to be zero so what we
have then is h-bar K for the hole over

151
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:48,550
这里加上电子的h-bar K应该在这里应该给我们
here plus h-bar K for the electron
should which is over here should give us

152
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:57,250
到目前为止，总数为零，这意味着H Bar K为一个孔
a total of zero so far so good
so that means that H Bar K for a hole

153
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:07,990
对于丢失的电子，它必须为负h-bar K，所以这是一种很好的方法
must be minus h-bar K for the missing
electron okay so that's a good way to

154
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:13,330
跟踪孔的动量应该是什么
keep track of what the momentum of a
hole should be there's one of these

155
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:18,940
令人困惑的减号现在让我们考虑一下这是什么速度
confusing minus signs now let's think
about given this what the velocity is of

156
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,920
这些东西的顶部实际上是一个洞
a hole at the top of them these things
are all actually going to be end up

157
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,280
很重要，因为您需要知道电子或空穴的方向
being important because you need to know
which way the electrons or the holes are

158
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,010
移动跟踪它，以了解带底部的电子
moving keeping track of it for an
electron at the bottom of the band

159
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,300
一切似乎都很自然，但是乐队顶部的一个洞开始了
everything seems very natural but a hole
at the top of the band everything starts

160
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,040
变得困惑，所以正确地跟踪这些很重要，所以让我们
getting confused so it's important to
keep track of these correctly so let's

161
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:51,130
考虑带子顶部的孔洞速度，所以我们再次开始
think about velocity of hole at top of
band at top of band so again we start

162
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:57,640
带的能量在带的顶部，所以不减H 
with the energy for the electron at the
top of the band so that's not minus H

163
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:05,020
条形平方K平方K电子平方2m星孔好吧，为什么我
bar squared K squared K electron squared
over 2m star hole okay now why did I

164
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,000
以此方式绘制，使M星孔的能量大于零。 
draw it this way so M star hole is
greater than zero the energy for the

165
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,420
电子随着远离K的电子动量增加而减小
electron decreases as you increase the
momentum of the electron away from K

166
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,830
等于零，带正在向下弯曲，因此电子的能量为
equals zero the band is curving down so
the energy for the electron is

167
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:26,800
降低组速度然后总是
decreasing
the group velocity then which is always

168
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,950
在H bar D上为1，所以这是电子D电子DJ的群速度
1 over H bar D so this is a group
velocity for the electron D electron DJ

169
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:42,130
因此，电子在整个m星或整个M星上减去h-bar K电子
electron is then minus h-bar K electron
over m star whole or since M star whole

170
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:48,850
是负M星电子，我们可以将其写为m星上的H Bar K e 
is minus M star the electron we can
write this as H Bar K e over m star

171
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,880
电子，但M星电子小于零，所以这意味着如果我
electron but M star electron is is less
than zero so what this means is if I

172
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,510
如果我有一个像这样的空带并且在顶部附近有一个电子
have a if I had an empty band like this
and I had an electron here near the top

173
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:06,520
该带的速度实际上是这个电子的速度B 
of the band the velocity of this
electron is actually going this way B

174
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,360
小组正朝着手套走，因为您可以将其视为
group is going this way right the mitt
because you can think of that as the

175
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,630
电子质量趋于负是因为负
electron mass is going negative is
negative because of the negative

176
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,710
因此，群速度实际上与
curvature so the group velocity is
actually in the opposite direction as

177
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,980
波矢好吧，我知道是我知道这令人困惑，但是你知道你是否
the wave vector okay I know it's I know
it's confusing but but you know if you

178
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,120
只需仔细跟踪迹象，一切都会正确，让我们
just keep track of the signs carefully
everything comes out correct let's

179
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,040
如果我们用术语来考虑的话，可以将其与能源的情况进行比较
compare that to the energy to the
situation if we think about it in terms

180
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:40,089
孔的能量，所以靠近带顶部的孔的能量是恒定的
of holes so the energy of a hole near
the top of the band is some constant

181
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:47,890
再加上h bar平方K整平方超过2m星整，所以洞的能量
plus h bar squared K whole squared over
2m star whole so the energy of the hole

182
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:52,330
随着您远离频段顶部而增加其动量而增加，因此
increases as you increase its momentum
away from the top of the band so the

183
00:16:52,330 --> 00:17:02,560
组速度V组整体等于H之上de整体DK整体等于H 
group velocity V group whole equals one
over H bar de whole DK whole equals H

184
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:11,589
 K整体超过m星整体，而K整体我们刚刚决定是同一件事
Bar K whole over m star whole and K
whole we just decided is the same thing

185
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,329
因为电子的负K等于负KH bar H Bar K 
as minus K for the electron so this is
the same thing as minus K H bar H Bar K

186
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:24,910
电子在毫米星孔上，这实际上与我们刚刚计算的相同
electron over mm star hole which is in
fact the same thing we just calculated

187
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,750
在这里，这里的意思是，如果我们有一个像这样的充满乐队
up here so the point here is that if we
have a filled band like this and one

188
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,120
空状态，这里的群速度朝这个方向
empty state here the group velocity of
that is going in this direction

189
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,990
同样，这是一个非常重要的原则，将再次出现
as well this is an extremely important
principle that will come back many times

190
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,450
或至少几次，但一个状态的速度
or at least several times but the
velocity of a state the velocity of an

191
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:58,830
轨道的轨道独立于该轨道是否为
orbital of an orbital orbital is
independent of whether that orbital is

192
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:14,130
填充轨道是否已填充，这样一堆就可以想到它
filled whether the orbital is filled so
you can think of it as you have a bunch

193
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,820
系统中的轨道数，并且轨道可以具有一定的速度
of orbitals in your system and the
orbitals have some velocity you can put

194
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,880
在那个轨道上的电子，电子将随着
an electron in that orbital and the
electron will move with that out with

195
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,320
那个速度，如果你从轨道上移走电子，它仍然是轨道
that velocity if you remove the electron
from that orbital it's still the orbital

196
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,860
仍然以相同的速度运动，只是其中没有电子
is still moving with the same velocity
it's just there's no electron in it okay

197
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,800
所以这是一个重要的原则，实际上
so this is kind of an important
principle which sort of it it actually

198
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,090
即使我们想到您就知道我们
makes a very good amount of sense even
when we think about you know the we

199
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,540
考虑氢原子或我们考虑这些轨道的某些事物
think about hydrogen atom or something
we think about these orbitals being

200
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,730
那里是否有电子存在于轨道和轨道中
there whether or not the there's an
electron in the orbital and the orbitals

201
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,270
可以以一定速度移动，它们仍然在那里并移动
can be moving with some velocity and
they're still there and moving

202
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,520
不管我们放电子还是不放电子
independent of whether we put the
electron in or we didn't put the

203
00:18:53,520 --> 00:19:01,890
电子没问题，好吧，现在让我们实际尝试掌握我们学到的知识
electron in okay all right so let's now
actually try to take what we've learned

204
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:10,580
并计算一些电子动力学和空穴动力学
and calculate some dynamics dynamics of
electrons and holes dynamics of

205
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:19,730
电子和空穴的乔恩氏和空穴以及最简单的方法
electrons and holes
jon's and holes and the simplest way to

206
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:25,140
处理动力学是我们开始考虑提请的术语
handle dynamics is what we started the
term with which is to think about drew

207
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:31,800
回到理论上，所以我们将在数周后回到juda理论上，所以让我们回想一下
to theory so we're back to juda theory
after many weeks and so let's recall the

208
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,350
我们得出一些p点的Drude方程等于f只是牛顿方程
Drude equation that we derived some p
dot equals f just newton's equations

209
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:44,880
拖曳项p超过tau，我们可以将其写成电子或
with a drag term p over tau and we can
write that out for electrons or

210
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,600
电子，我们将拥有我所拥有的电子的质量
electrons
we will have mass of the electron I'm

211
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,470
要在这里加一个星星乘以V点，所以唯一与我们不同的是
going to put a star here times V dot so
the only thing different from what we

212
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:59,850
学期开始时做的是我现在在质量旁边放一颗星，所以
did at the beginning of the term is I'm
now putting a star next to the mass so

213
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,149
它是带底部的有效曲率
it's it's the effective mass the
curvature at the bottom of the band that

214
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:07,289
不管裸电子质量有多大， 
matters not the bare electron mass
there's not an important quantity in a

215
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:13,710
半导体或绝缘体将具有通常的力
semiconductor or an insulator it will
have the force the usual the usual

216
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:19,139
永远与您同在的洛伦兹力量永远不会再有一个笑话
Lorentz force which is always with you
there's a another joke all right never

217
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:21,200
心神
mind

218
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:26,070
电子的tau大于电子的散射时间，因此
the over tau for the electron the
scattering time for the electron so this

219
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,840
应该看起来很熟悉，这就是我们得出的运输方程
should look fairly familiar this is the
drew de transport equation that we had

220
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,129
在有一些加速度和质量乘以加速度之前，有一些
before there's some acceleration and
mass times acceleration there's some

221
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:38,549
力在电子上有负E的电荷，有洛伦兹力， 
force there's a charge of minus E on the
electron there's a Lorentz force and

222
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:43,500
无论我们在谈论什么，这里都有一个阻力
there's a drag force here this equation
holds true whether we're talking about

223
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,100
在带的底部附近的电子或在带的顶部附近的电子
an electron near the bottom of band or
an electron near the top of the band

224
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,740
但是，在波段的顶部附近，质量的符号变为负， 
however near the top of the band the
sign of the mass gets to be negative and

225
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,269
这似乎有点不可思议，但是如果我们考虑一下它的顶部
that seems a little bit weird
but if we think about it near top of

226
00:20:57,269 --> 00:21:05,190
我们可以考虑考虑到带孔等式，因此在带的顶部附近有一个带
band near top of band a band we can
consider drew to equation for holes so

227
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:10,559
我们将有一个M星洞乘以相同的洞的速度
we would have an M star hole times the
velocity of the hole same drew to

228
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:16,440
等式，但孔上的电荷现在为正e再次写等于
equation but the charge on the hole is
now plus e write this again equals plus

229
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,850
 e孔上的电荷为正e，那么我们有E加V叉B的力
e the charge on the hole is plus e then
we have E Plus V cross B rents force and

230
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:30,269
然后，在一定的散射时间内，减去M星孔的速度
then minus M star hole velocity of the
hole over some scattering time for the

231
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:36,330
也有孔，所以我们在带顶部的孔有一个judor方程
hole as well so we have a judor equation
for the holes at the top of the band as

232
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:43,049
现在，请记住，我们这里有两件事我们有两个方程式
well now remember that the we have two
things here we have two equations one

233
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,399
对于电子，对于空穴，两个方程的差是
for the electrons one for the holes and
the difference in the two equations is

234
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:51,570
电荷的符号对于空穴上的电子是不同的
that the sign of the charge is different
for the electrons on the holes but also

235
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:57,960
 M星孔被定义为电子的负M星，因此实际上这些
M star hole was defined to be minus M
star of the electron so in fact these

236
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,410
如果两个方程正好乘以两个方程
two equations are exactly the
if this equation has been multiplied by

237
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:07,180
整个负1 / m星整个是负电子m星，所以实际上
an overall minus 1/m star whole is minus
m star the electron and so it's actually

238
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:12,370
只是重复完全相同的Drude方程，所以实际上
just repeating exactly the same Drude
equation so this is actually quite

239
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,920
重要的是，我刚才在这里写的那句话完全一样
important it's exactly the same
statement that I just wrote over here

240
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,300
无论您说的是什么，国家的动态都是完全相同的
the dynamics of the state are exactly
the same whether you're talking about an

241
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,870
电子移动这种状态或空穴移动的状态不存在
electron moving this state or a hole
moving the state the absence of an

242
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:26,860
电子，轨道是否仍以相同的动力学运动
electron the orbital still moves with
the same dynamics whether or not the

243
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,950
轨道充满了一个电子好，所以关于
orbital is filled with an electron okay
good so the thing that's funny about the

244
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,250
这些半导体中的犹大方程式是
the Judah equation in these
semiconductors is if you're up at the

245
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,450
在乐队的顶部，您可以选择看起来似乎都有点的两件事
top of the band you have a choice of two
things that both seemed a little bit

246
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,740
一种奇怪的可能性是，您必须考虑负质量
weird one possibility is that you have
to think about a negative mass for the

247
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,500
电子，如果您正在考虑状态中的电子
electrons if you're thinking about
electrons in the state the other

248
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,180
可能是您考虑了积极的质量漏洞，但现在这些都是积极的
possibility is you think about positive
mass holes but now these are positively

249
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,760
带电粒子现在可以解决我们的旧难题之一
charged particles now this resolves one
of our old puzzles old puzzle from the

250
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:08,770
学期老难题的第二天或第三天，这就是为什么霍尔的迹象
second day or the third day of term old
puzzle which was why is sign of Hall

251
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:24,310
系数霍尔系数有时为正，因此您会记得
coefficients Hall coefficient sometimes
positive so you'll recall that we

252
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,260
根据犹大理论得出，霍尔系数是电荷的n倍以上的1 
derived in judah theory that the hall
coefficient is 1 over n times the charge

253
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,510
在粒子周围运动时，这是电子上的电荷，因此，如果您有一个
on the particle moving around this is a
charge on the electron so if you have a

254
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:38,020
几乎是空的带，它们只是几个电子在运动
band which is mostly empty and they're
just a couple of electrons are moving

255
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,380
周围有犹大理论，这些电子像
around then you have Judah theory for
these electrons moving around just like

256
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,310
我们在一开始就以索末菲理论或犹大理论思考过
we thought about in Sommerfeld theory or
in judah theory at the beginning of the

257
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,850
学期，您将获得一个为负的停止系数，但如果您有异动症
term and you'll get a halt coefficient
which is negative but if you have afib

258
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:53,290
而且大部分都被填充了，在顶部您只剩下几个孔
and which is mostly filled and you just
have a couple of holes in the top of the

259
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:57,190
乐队跑来跑去，无论哪种方式，您对它的看法如何
band running around then either way you
look at it what do you think about it as

260
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:01,030
带有正电荷的孔，或者您认为它是
holes running around with a positive
charge or you think about it as

261
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,500
电子到处跑，但是现在电子的质量是负的
electrons running around but now the
mass of the electron is negative what

262
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,190
你会得到的是，你会得到相反的符号，因为现在携带东西的东西
you'll get is you'll get the opposite
sign because now the things carrying the

263
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:12,490
充电有错误的信号，他们已经暂停
charge have have the wrong sign they
have pause

264
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:18,490
号而不是负号，所以这是您知道犹大可能要做的是
sign instead of negative sign so this is
what you know Judah might have to do is

265
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:24,220
可以回溯到1901年
to way back in 1901 that it appeared
that for some materials for some reason

266
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,090
电荷携带者的标志有误，实际上这就是其中的原因
the charge carrier had the wrong sign
and indeed that's what's going on in

267
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,710
在某些材料中，电荷是由空穴而非电子携带的，因此，如果您
some materials the charge is carried by
holes rather than electrons so if you

268
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,700
有半导体，而你掺杂了电子，你总会得到
have a semiconductor and you and you
dope it with electrons you always get

269
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,910
整个系数的这个符号如果您用孔掺杂它，您将得到
this sign of the whole coefficient if
you dope it with holes you'll get the

270
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,200
现在对金属来说，霍尔系数的符号相反
opposite sign of the Hall coefficient
now for metals real you know real metals

271
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,580
例如钙，铍，锰或类似的东西
like calcium or beryllium or manganese
or something like that which are not

272
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,210
只是轻掺杂，他们知道我们有一些复杂的能带结构
just lightly doped where they you know
we have some complicated band structure

273
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,500
目前尚不清楚应该发出什么信号，因为您可以
it's less clear what the sign of this is
supposed to come out as because you can

274
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:00,940
就像上次讲课中我们讨论过的钙一样， 
have a situation like we discussed with
calcium in the last lecture where you

275
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,170
有一个部分充满的路易斯乐队和一个部分充满的最高乐队，所以您可以
have a partially filled Louis band and a
partially filled highest band so you can

276
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:09,309
认为它在第一个青铜器中有一些孔，在第一个青铜器中有一些孔
think of it as having some holes in the
first bronze own some holes in the first

277
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,970
带，但是第二个带中有一些电子，所以空穴正试图给你
band but some electrons in the second
band so the holes are trying to give you

278
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,030
霍尔系数为正时，第二个带中的电子正在尝试
a positive Hall coefficient the
electrons in the second band are trying

279
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,940
给你一个负的霍尔系数，因为他们两个互相竞争
to give you a negative Hall coefficient
to the two of them compete with each

280
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,820
其他，然后您必须开始担心哪个具有更大的
other and then you have to start
worrying about which one has a greater

281
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,110
散布时间还可以，所以对于实际而言，它变得有点复杂
scattering time okay so it gets a little
bit more complicated for real for

282
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,450
真正的真正金属，例如铍或锰或钙，但对于
genuine real metals like beryllium or or
manganese or calcium but in the case of

283
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,950
掺杂的半导体，如果您基本上有电子，就会非常清楚地显示出来
a doped semiconductor it comes out very
clearly if you have basically electron

284
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:39,070
如果你基本上有空洞，你会得到霍尔系数的这个符号
transport you get this sign of the Hall
coefficient if you have basically hole

285
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,850
到目前为止，您的霍尔系数的符号相反
transport you have the opposite sign of
the Hall coefficient so far so good

286
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,480
所以我们解决了这个难题，当我提到其他问题时
so we've resolved this one puzzle there
was something else that I mentioned when

287
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,420
我们在学期开始时就一直谈论Garuda理论
we talked about Garuda theory all the
way back at the beginning of the term

288
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:57,520
请记住，犹大理论非常有效，对于半导体行业来说
remember the Judah theory works well
works well for semiconductors for

289
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,890
半导体为什么除了可以得到信号的事实
semiconductors why is that besides the
fact that it can get the sign

290
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,460
明智地选择犹大理论的原因
intelligently the reason why Judah
Theory works particularly well for

291
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:12,130
半导体是因为通常在您谈论半导体时
semiconductors is because usually when
you're talking about semiconductors

292
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,460
您正在谈论的载流子密度非常低
you're talking about a very low density
of charge carriers you're talking about

293
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:20,590
导带中只有几个电子或化合价中只有几个空穴
just a few electrons in the conduction
band or just a few holes in the valence

294
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:29,110
带是否因为密度低而低
band because
because density is low is low whether

295
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:32,620
我们说的是导带中的电子或化合价中的空穴
we're talking about electrons in the
conduction band or holes in the valence

296
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,660
乐队的密度相当低，为什么这会帮助您犹大的原因
band the density is fairly low and why
does that help you the reason that Judah

297
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:42,100
我们第一次学习理论失败了，是因为我们
Theory failed back when we were studying
it for the first time is because we

298
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,429
忽略了费米统计，而忽略了电子是
neglected Fermi statistics we neglected
the fact that the electrons were

299
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:51,490
费米子，这使我们搞砸了所有这些东西，例如热容
fermions and that made us mess up all of
these things like the the heat capacity

300
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:55,390
我们完全错了，因为我们忽略了费米的统计资料，但是如果
we got that completely wrong because we
neglected Fermi statistics but if the

301
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:59,980
密度真的很低，您实际上有权忽略费米统计量，为什么
density is really low you're actually
entitled to neglect Fermi statistics why

302
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,909
如果有两个电子的概率落在
is that well if the probability of
having two electrons ever sit in the

303
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:07,390
同一轨道非常低，因为这些电子的密度非常高
same orbital is extremely low because
the density of these electrons is very

304
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:11,350
低，那么您可以将它们视为经典粒子Maxwell Boltzmann 
low then you can just treat these as
classical particles Maxwell Boltzmann

305
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,440
微粒可能是因为它们不太可能会坐在
particles could because it's very
unlikely they're going to sit in the

306
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,929
相同的轨道，首先是一种更好定义的表达方式
same orbital and in the first place a
sort of better defined way of saying

307
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:25,539
在给定密度的情况下，费米能量即为
that is the Fermi energy given this
density the Fermi energy increases with

308
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:29,320
如果密度低，则费米能量低如果密度低，则费米能量低
density if the density is low the Fermi
energy is low if the Fermi energy is

309
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,460
比密度低时的温度要低得多
much less than the temperature which
would be true if the density is low then

310
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:38,110
您不必担心费米统计信息就可以处理粒子
you don't have to worry about Fermi
statistics you can treat the particles

311
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:50,320
因为是经典的浸泡方式，所以颗粒是经典的，所以您可以
as being classical soaking so particles
are classical are classical and you can

312
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:56,140
仅考虑常规的经典德鲁伊和经典的玻尔兹曼动力学理论
consider just regular classical Druid a
theory classical Boltzmann dynamics

313
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,620
 Maxwell Boltzmann分布而不必担心费米分布
Maxwell Boltzmann distribution without
worrying about Fermi distributions so

314
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:07,690
这是是的，是要做什么，是的，我们将在稍后介绍这个问题，但是
this is yes what do to hold yes holes
will we'll come to that in a moment but

315
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:11,289
孔也确实服从我的统计数据，只有在考虑了
holes also do obey for me statistics you
can only put if you think about it for a

316
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,850
第二步，如果您以
second you can only put one hole in a
particular K State if you start with the

317
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,440
价带已满，一旦不能再取出就可以取出
valence band filled you can take it out
once you can't take it out again okay

318
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,510
是的，孔确实服从了费米的统计，他们是费米子，所以这是
yes holes do obey Fermi statistics they
are fermions all right so this is

319
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:29,470
实际上将我们带到了统计力学领域，或者
actually bringing us to the to the realm
of statistical mechanics or

320
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:34,690
我们粒子在半导体中的热力学，所以我们必须开始
thermodynamics of our particles in in
semiconductors so we have to start

321
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:40,190
考虑诸如从中激发多少电子
thinking about things like how many
how many electrons get excited from the

322
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,029
价带到导带，它们如何到达那里，它们是什么
valence band to the conduction band how
did they get there and what are they

323
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:49,999
他们一旦到达那里，温度就会受到什么影响，所以一件事
doing once they're there what's the
effect of temperature so one thing that

324
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:54,470
我在上一讲中告诉您，我应该多一点
I told you from the in the last lecture
that I should be a little bit more

325
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,879
老实说我们要回去思考一下掺杂问题，以及如何
honest about we're going to go back to
think about doping for a second and how

326
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:10,070
掺杂受温度掺杂和温度的影响，所以让我们回想一下
doping is affected by temperature doping
and temperature okay so let's recall

327
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:18,889
当我们结束时，像磷磷一样打开和打开
that when we took a end opened and
opened like like phosphorus voss in

328
00:29:18,889 --> 00:29:25,669
硅和掺杂剂，我们写道磷等于硅加一
silicon and dopant we wrote that
phosphorus equals a silicon plus one

329
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:30,889
质子加一个电子，我告诉你电子进入传导
proton plus one electron and I told you
the electron goes into the conduction

330
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:40,009
带到导带，我告诉你忽略了
band into conduction band band and I
told you to ignore the fact that there's

331
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:46,399
一个额外的质子现在可以忽略这个问题，可以忽略额外的质子
an extra proton ignore now this issue of
being able to ignore the extra proton

332
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,869
我们另外加上的东西实际上是我们必须要做的
that we put in in addition that is
something that is actually we have to be

333
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,409
多注意一点，我们必须担心温度和
a little bit more careful about and we
have to worry about temperature and

334
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:57,590
问这样的事情是否可以忽略它，所以请考虑
things like that to ask whether it's
it's okay to ignore it so think about

335
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,330
稍微小心一点，我们放一个质子，放一个电子
this a little bit more carefully we put
in a proton and we put in an electron so

336
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,779
当您将它们放在一起时，电子和质子是做什么的
what is an electron and a proton do when
you put them together what's really

337
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:11,919
即将发生的事情是您将要形成一个氢原子或氢学术分子
going to happen is you're going to form
form a hydrogen atom or hydrogen academ

338
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:18,919
氢原子，我们将电子置于导带中，但我们也将
hydrogenic atom we put the electron in
the conduction band but we also put a

339
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:22,549
后面带正电荷，电子将购买正电荷
positive charge behind and the electron
is going to buy into that positive

340
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:26,389
电荷被库仑相互作用吸引到该正电荷，所以您
charge it's attracted to that positive
charge by Coulomb interaction so you

341
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:31,279
形成氢原子，但它不是普通的氢原子
form a hydrogen atom but it's not a
regular hydrogen atom it's slightly

342
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:39,710
与氢原子不同，因为一个M星不是M不是质量
different from a hydrogen atom because
one M star not M not the mass of the

343
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,700
电子是电子的有效质量，而不是电子的质量
electron it's the effective mass of the
electron not the mass of electron the

344
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,970
 M在导带中运动的电子动力学由M给出
dynamics of the electron running around
in the conduction band is given by M

345
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,580
恒星不是电子的裸质量，所以差一
star not the bare mass of the electron
so that's difference one

346
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,170
第二个区别是您在库仑中学到的东西
the second difference is something you
learned in a.m. in the Coulomb

347
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,690
相互作用吸引质子的能量在4 PI epsilon上平方
interaction the attraction back to the
proton is e squared over 4 PI epsilon

348
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:08,520
零ε相对时间RRε相对介电常数
naught epsilon relative times R R
epsilon a relative dielectric constant

349
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:20,630
相对介电常数不是通常的4 PIε的平方而不是R 
relative dielectric constant not the
usual a squared over 4 PI epsilon not R

350
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:27,990
好了，库仑相互作用被相对介电常数降低了
ok so the the Coulomb interaction is is
reduced by the relative dielectric

351
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,500
恒定，因为您生活在半导体中，而不是生活在真空中
constant because you're living in a
semiconductor not living in the vacuum

352
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,580
空间，所以如果您还记得我们是规则氢原子，规则氢
of outer space so if you recall we're
regular hydrogen atom regular hydrogen

353
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:48,260
规则的氢原子有一个结合能e结合
regular hydrogen atom there's a binding
energy e binding which is well ok you

354
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:54,540
也许很好，也许还记得这个公式，它是8 epsilon naughter squared 
probably well maybe do remember this
formula it's 8 epsilon naught squared

355
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,550
普朗克常数平方，但您可能还记得魔术数字
Planck's constant squared but you
probably remember the magic number

356
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:06,420
十三点六e V是一个孤峰，所以这是a的结合能
thirteen point six e V which is a rid
berg so this is the binding energy of a

357
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:13,310
规则氢原子，但在半导体中的结合能e 
regular hydrogen atom but in a
semiconductor the binding energy e

358
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:19,860
电子与质子的结合将我放的额外电荷
binding of the electron back to the
proton the additional charge that I put

359
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:27,750
现在掺杂物中的M星电子e超过8 epsil 
in with the dopant is now M star
electron e to the fourth over 8 epsilon

360
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:36,990
 H平方上没有相对的ε平方，然后我可以写成M星
relative epsilon naught squared over H
squared which I can then write as M star

361
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:43,800
电子的质量除以电子的质量乘以ε的1 
of the electron divided by the mass of
the electrons times 1 over epsilon

362
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:51,570
相对平方时间13.6 TV现在，此表达式可能有很大不同
relative squared times 13.6 TV now this
expression can be a whole lot different

363
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:56,400
从13.6电视开始，通常情况下它会小很多
from 13.6 TV and generically it's going
to be a lot smaller typically effective

364
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,180
电子和半导体的质量可以是电子质量的三分之一
masses of electrons and semiconductors
can be a third of the mass of an

365
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,810
电子甚至可以是电子质量的十分之一甚至更小
electron it can be even a tenth of the
mass with electron or even smaller the

366
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,940
电常数半导体可以是
die
electric constant semiconductors can be

367
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,140
像10这样的数字，这意味着该数字的实际结合能
numbers like 10 so that means that this
number the actual binding energy of the

368
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,279
电子到半导体中的质子可能是一个因素
electron to the proton in the
semiconductor can be as much as a factor

369
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:23,519
比这少一千分之一
of a thousand less than this for example
in silicon in silicon key binding of the

370
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:31,200
对于电子伏特来说，回到其掺杂核的电子为0.04 
electron back to its dopant nucleus is
0.04 for electron volts a much much much

371
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,640
较小的数字，现在为什么这么重要好吧，哦，看这个
smaller number now why is that important
okay oh look at this

372
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:44,460
我需要学院把它放在这里，我要画画，所以这是底部
I need that Academy put this in here I'm
going to draw the so here's the bottom

373
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,799
导带的这里是价带的顶部，所以当您添加掺杂剂时
of the conduction band here's the top of
a valence band so when you put a dopant

374
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,350
当你把磷掺杂剂形成一个结合态
in when you put the phosphorous dopant
in you form a bound state which is a

375
00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:02,730
导带底部下方的结合距离非常短
very small distance a binding be binding
below the bottom of the conduction band

376
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:07,470
因此，通过绑定而不是仅仅坐在K上，您可以获得一点能量
so you gain a tiny bit of energy by
binding instead of just sitting with K

377
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,560
在导带中等于零，您可以通过束缚获得一点能量
equals zero in the conduction band you
gain a little bit of energy by binding

378
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,960
到你来自的正核
to the positive nucleus that you came
from

379
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,349
但是这里的能量很小，在室温下
however this energy here is very very
small and at room temperature at room

380
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:34,589
温度降到t室时，电子自由断裂，自由断裂， 
temperature is down at t room the
electron breaks free breaks free and

381
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:44,099
进入导带，自由破裂并进入导带
goes off into the conduction band breaks
free and goes into conduction band

382
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,389
它只是被热激发到导带中，这就是为什么
it's just thermally excited into the
conduction band and this is why this is

383
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:57,660
为什么在我们向硅添加磷掺杂时可以考虑一下
why it's okay to think about when we add
phosphorus doping to silicon we really

384
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,839
应该只考虑室温或更高的温度
should just think a on room temperature
or a higher temperature we should think

385
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,080
关于这只是将电子直接添加到导带中，如果
about this is just directly adding
electrons into the conduction band if

386
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,310
你把它冷却一下如果我把它冷却一下也许我会写下来
you cool it down if you cool this maybe
I'll write that down

387
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:16,880
因此，掺杂增加了电子，直接增加了
so doping adds electrons adds directly
to

388
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:27,299
 -导带或类似的（如果在添加时对孔做相同的事情） 
- conduction band or similarly if you do
the same thing with holes when you add

389
00:35:27,299 --> 00:35:34,349
在孔中，它将与上的负电荷形成束缚态
in the hole it would form a bound state
to the to the negative charge on the

390
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:38,400
我们留下的核被放入硼，铝或
nucleus that we left behind we're
putting in a boron or an aluminum or

391
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,180
在有限的温度下，空穴会脱离其原子核并运行
something and at finite temperature that
hole breaks free of its nucleus and runs

392
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:53,010
进入价带，但是在低温下
off into the valence band however at low
temperature at low temperature the

393
00:35:53,010 --> 00:36:00,319
电子变得被束缚，变得被束缚，再次被束缚到掺杂核
electron becomes becomes bound becomes
bound again bound to the dopant nucleus

394
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:11,400
再次掺杂核，所以如果您要测量
to dopant nucleus nucleus again so if
you were measuring the density of

395
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,440
如果您将系统完全冷却，则导带中的电子
electrons in the conduction band
if you cooled the system down a lot all

396
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,049
突然间，您会发现传导中的电子密度
of a sudden you would discover that the
density of electrons in the conduction

397
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:23,579
能带下降是因为所有这些电子都被冻结回到
band was dropping because all of these
electrons were getting frozen back onto

398
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,119
他们由此产生的核被称为载体冻结
their the nucleus that they came from
this is known as carrier freeze-out

399
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:42,599
运营商冻结了，好吧，到目前为止，很好，每个人都对此感到满意
carrier freeze-out okay all right so so
far so good everyone happy with this all

400
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:47,099
对，现在是时候认真思考一下统计力学了
right so now it's time to do some
serious statistical mechanics thinking

401
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:51,390
关于我们在导带中应该有多少个电子或多少个空穴
about how many electrons we should have
in the conduction band or how many holes

402
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,150
我们应该在价带中有一个相当重要的计算
we should have in the valence band this
is a rather important calculation that

403
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:01,950
实际上经常出现在考试中，所以这是一件好事
actually shows up on exams very
frequently so it's a good thing to go

404
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:06,839
好几次，所以让我们从这种通用
through several times all right so let's
a start with this sort of generic

405
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,789
导带底部的图片价带顶部的图片
picture of the bottom of a conduction
band the top of a valence band

406
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,880
他们通常不必放出相同的曲率
they don't have to have the same
curvature in general they put out

407
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,000
我已经画出了不同的有效质量
different effective masses I've drawn
the effective mass is being slightly

408
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,140
不同的是他们不必对齐，这可能是间接的差距
different they don't have to be aligned
the it could be an indirect gap the top

409
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,020
价带的可能与底部的位置不同
of the valence band could be in a
different place than the bottom of the

410
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,990
导带，我们称之为能量e导通
conduction band we'll call this energy e
conduction

411
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:36,190
传导中的ec4将称此能量ev 4e价称此能量e间隙C子G 
ec4 in conduction will call this energy
e v 4e valence this energy e gap C sub G

412
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:43,450
和E间隙等于e传导-价，我们可以想象化学
and E gap equals e conduction - valence
and we'll imagine that the chemical

413
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,600
潜力在乐队的中间，我们将尝试找出
potential is somewhere in the middle of
the band and we'll try to figure out

414
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:53,200
没关系，所以我们从价带开始
where it is all right and so the we
start with the valence band being

415
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,820
完全填满，我们将尝试弄清楚添加时会发生什么
completely filled and we're going to try
to figure out what happens when we add

416
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:02,050
温度，所以我们需要做的几件事是光谱
temperature so a couple of things we're
going to need one is what the spectra

417
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:08,320
因此，对于我们的能量大于能量传导，我们拥有的能量是
are so for our energy greater than
energy conduction we have energy it's

418
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:17,980
这些能量传导的K函数+ H bar平方K-K min平方超过2m 
function of K these energy conduction +
H bar squared K - K min squared over 2m

419
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:27,640
星形电子，然后对于能量小于化合价的能量，我们有倒置的空间
star electron and then for energy less
than a valence we have the upside-down

420
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:40,750
抛物线ek等于evi减去H bar平方K-K max平方超过2m m星
parabola ek equals evince minus H bar
squared K - K max squared over 2m m star

421
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:45,640
整体+ M星整体记住正，我们曲率负
whole + M star whole remember is
positive we have a negative curvature of

422
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,250
乐队的顶端，然后我们必须考虑数国家
the top of the band and then we have to
think about counting States so counting

423
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:58,650
状态，我们会回想起我们对自由电子进行Sommerfeld理论的时间
States and we'll think back to when we
did Sommerfeld theory for free electrons

424
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:08,560
对于自由电子，我们的能量很好，e等于H bar平方K 
for free electrons we had well our
energy was e equals H bar squared K

425
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,600
平方超过2m且状态密度为单位的状态密度
squared over 2m and the density of
states so the density of states per unit

426
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:21,510
 e的体积阱G由该表达式给出，我们将其计算为质量
volume well G of e was given by this
expression which we calculated to mass

427
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:32,109
到2 pi平方的H条立方化epsilon的三分之二到1/2 
to the three-halves over 2 pi squared H
bar cubed epsilon to the 1/2 we

428
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:36,869
我在学期的第二天或第三天计算了这个
calculated this I think on the second or
third day of the term this is the

429
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:42,170
单位体积中状态的密度
density of states out of states per unit
volume

430
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:51,470
每卷的状态，因此我们希望使用完全相同的计算，除了
States per volume so we'd like to use
exactly the same calculation except for

431
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:56,119
导带和价带，所以实际上没有做功
the conduction band and the valence band
here so without actually doing the work

432
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:00,529
很容易看到随着密度的增加会产生什么结果
it's pretty easy to see what the result
is going to come out as the density of

433
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:05,500
 e大于e的导带中的状态将是
states in the conduction band for e
greater than e conduction is going to be

434
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:13,339
电子的质量到三分之二除以相同的两个π 
to mass of the electrons star to the
three-halves divided by the same two pi

435
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:21,140
平方H立方，并且一半的e相同，但是e减去e 
squared H bar cubed and there's the same
e to the one-half but it's e minus e

436
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:24,470
导带，因此您正在测量相对于底部的能量
conduction band so you're measuring the
energy with respect to the bottom of the

437
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:28,160
导带抛物线从导带的底部开始，但
conduction band the parabola starts at
the bottom of the conduction band but

438
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,119
否则，这与人们满意的计算完全相同
otherwise it's exactly the same
calculation people happy with that okay

439
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,849
好，所以G价可能会稍微复杂一些，但不会太多
good so G valence may be a little bit
more complicated but not too much more

440
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:48,529
复杂的是要在两个pi平方高的H条上将M星孔分成三等分
complicated is to M star hole
three-halves over two pi squared H bar

441
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:55,130
立方，在这里我们测量EEEME，它可用于1/2和
cubed and here we measure
eeeem itís available to the 1/2 and

442
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:59,539
我们正在测量向下的方向，我们需要这个东西
we're measuring going in the downward
direction well we need this thing to the

443
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:04,279
 1/2是一个正数，所以它必须是价数减去e（我们测量下降） 
1/2 to be a positive number so it has to
be valence minus e we measure going down

444
00:41:04,279 --> 00:41:10,490
下降到低能耗状态，我们得到的州越来越多
we get an increasing number of states as
we go down to lower energy good alright

445
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:16,390
那么我们可以写导带
so then we can write in conduction band

446
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:25,130
我们只是用统计力学来计算电子密度n 
we just use our statistical mechanics
the density of electrons density n of

447
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:33,529
安逸的电子由n作为T的函数给出，即N等于
electrons of ease is given by n as a
function of T that's an N equals the

448
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:36,529
从导带底部到能量无穷大的积分
integral from the bottom of the
conduction band up to energy infinity

449
00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:41,930
状态的能量密度与能量和紧实度的关系
the energy density of states as a
function of energy and the firming

450
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:50,539
 β能量减去mu ok，所以状态密度的积分是
factor beta energy minus mu ok so the
integral of the density of states is

451
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:55,670
基本上是所有本征态的总和，费米因子可能是
basically a sum over all eigenstates and
the fermi factor is the probably

452
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:59,809
我会把状态填满，所以这只是数所有
that i ghen state is going to be filled
so this is just counting up all the

453
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,230
在给定温度下填充的状态，但我们需要知道
states that are filled at a given
temperature but we need to know what the

454
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:10,460
化学势还可以，所以现在我们要写出费米
chemical potential is okay so now we're
going to well let's write out the Fermi

455
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:18,140
费米函数是β能量减去mu加的一倍以上
function here the Fermi function is one
over e to the beta energy minus mu plus

456
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:26,510
现在，如果我们处于相当高的温度下或者密度低，或者
one now if if we're at a fairly high
temperature or if the density is low or

457
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:32,540
严格来说，我们需要的是β能量减去mu大于1 
strictly speaking what we need is beta
energy minus mu is much greater than one

458
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:43,040
这意味着mu远低于EC以下的远低于意指低于at 
this means that mu is much below much
below below EC meaning that below by at

459
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,049
最少的温度，所以您知道低于
least the amount of the temperature so
you know fairly well below the the

460
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:51,619
导带的底部，这很容易，因为
bottom of the conduction band and that's
pretty easy because the gaps between the

461
00:42:51,619 --> 00:42:54,440
导带和价带可以有几个电子伏特
conduction band and the valence band
there can be a couple of electron volts

462
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,930
比典型温度大得多，这意味着可以近似得出NF 
much bigger than typical temperatures
that means that NF can be approximated

463
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:05,480
好的，您基本上可以删除加号，而得到的只是
by well you basically can just drop the
plus one and you get the just the

464
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:12,140
常规的玻尔兹曼因数这是麦克斯韦的倍数
regular Boltzmann factor this is just
multiple on Maxwell Boltzmann Maxwell

465
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:23,930
玻尔兹曼，让我们输入，我们有n个T，那么它将是整数
Boltzmann so let's put that in and we
have n of T then is going to be integral

466
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:30,890
 d能量0对不起EC从导带的底部一直到G的无穷大
d energy 0 sorry EC from the bottom of
the conduction band up to infinity of G

467
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:35,900
能量，然后将麦克斯韦玻尔兹曼因子e减去负β能量减去
of energy and then the Maxwell Boltzmann
factor e to the minus beta energy minus

468
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:43,670
亩近似值，这是温度，那么我们该怎么做
mu making that approximation and this is
temperature then how do we do this

469
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:49,130
我们要做的第一件事就是要做好我们要做的事情
integral well first thing we're going to
do is we're going to well what are we

470
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:56,059
我们要写出这个G是什么，所以它有一颗2m星
going to do we're going to write out
what this G is so this has a 2m star of

471
00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:02,420
电子到三等分，它有一个2 pi平方的H形立方体，这个
the electron to the three-halves and it
has a 2 pi squared H bar cubed and this

472
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,589
积分能量能量导带
integral the energy energy the
conduction band

473
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:14,289
 dx e- e传导到1/2，然后e到负β能量-mu 
the d x e- e conduction to the 1/2 and
then e to the minus beta energy minus mu

474
00:44:14,289 --> 00:44:19,099
所以这是我们在那里的1/2的e，我们必须进行积分
so this is the e to the 1/2 that we have
up there and we have to do this integral

475
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:25,219
而我们进行积分的方法是将e减去负数
and the way we do this integral is by
shifting out a factor of e to the minus

476
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:33,650
 βEC在前面减去mu，所以我们剩下EC的积分d能量
beta EC minus mu out front so then we're
left with an integral d energy from EC

477
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:40,809
到无穷大u减去EC到1/2，然后e到减去beta e减去EC 
to infinity u minus EC to the 1/2 and
then e to the minus beta e minus EC

478
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:47,509
很好，如果我们想要x等于E减去EC，那么我们可以写
which is nice we can then write if we
want well x equals E minus EC if we want

479
00:44:47,509 --> 00:44:55,759
所以这成为DX的整数，从0到无穷大X到1/2 e到负数
so this becomes integral of DX from 0 to
infinity X to the 1/2 e to the minus

480
00:44:55,759 --> 00:45:02,569
 beta X，那么我们可以通过定义y平方等于x来进行积分
beta X then we can do that integral by
defining y squared equals x this becomes

481
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:07,489
一个简单的高斯积分，我们得到β减去三分之二的平方
a simple Gaussian integral and we get
beta the minus three-halves times square

482
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:15,940
 pi的根超过2可以，所以我们将它们放在一起，最终得到
root of pi over 2 okay so we put that
all together and we end up getting the

483
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:21,829
然后，导带中电子的密度与T的关系为
density of electrons in the conduction
band as a function of T is then putting

484
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:32,539
所有这些因素加起来，是PI H bar上电子星KBT质量的1/4 
together all those factors 1/4 to mass
of the electron star KBT over PI H bar

485
00:45:32,539 --> 00:45:40,400
等于三分之二的e到负β能量的导带
squared to the three-halves e to the
minus beta energy the conduction band of

486
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,799
减去亩，这就是我们的表达式，我们现在知道其中有多少个电子
minus mu so this is our expression we
now know how many electrons there are in

487
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:49,549
导带是温度的函数，是MU的函数
the conduction band is a function of
temperature and is a function of MU the

488
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:52,819
重要的是要带走一些前提因素，不是
important thing to take away there's
some pre factors here which aren't that

489
00:45:52,819 --> 00:46:01,369
至关重要的是这里要带走的重要东西基本上是被激活的
crucial the important thing here to take
away is is basically activated that you

490
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:05,210
必须激活从化学势到传导的能量
have to activate the energy up from the
chemical potential into the conduction

491
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:08,749
带，以便当您使电子下降时将电子带入导带
band in order to get an electron into
the conduction band as you drop the

492
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:12,079
温度导带中的电子数将下降
temperature the number of electrons in
the conduction band is going to drop

493
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,269
到目前为止，一切都很好，现在我们必须做同样的事情
exponentially okay all right so far so
good now we have to do the same thing

494
00:46:17,269 --> 00:46:20,090
对于漏洞，我认为我们仍然可以及时做到
for holes I think we can still do this
in time

495
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:25,880
价带中的孔数好吧，让我们写下来
the number of holes in the valence band
well okay let's write that that's going

496
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:31,280
从负无穷大到价带D能量的顶部积分
to be integral from minus infinity to
the top of the valence band D energy the

497
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,400
在价带中的状态密度，然后我写1减去费米
density of states in the valence band
and then I'll write 1 minus the Fermi

498
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:43,370
价带βepsilon减去nu减去我的因子-为什么这么好
factor in the valence band beta epsilon
minus nu minus me--it why is that well

499
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,930
如果电子为状态的概率为费米函数，则
if the probability of an electron being
a state is the Fermi function then the

500
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,680
空穴为无电子状态的概率为1减去
probability of a hole being the state
the absence of electron is 1 minus the

501
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,910
 Fermi的功能还不错，所以在这里我们基本上要考虑这个因素
Fermi function good all right so this
factor here we're going to basically go

502
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:04,730
通过相同的操作，所以这可以写成1减去1等于e 
through the same manipulation so this is
we can write this as a 1 minus 1 over e

503
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:11,030
到beta epsilon的是mu加1会消失哦我的空间不足
to the beta epsilon is mu plus 1 that
becomes out oh I'm running out of space

504
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:15,860
我不是很好吗，这东西变成这个
aren't I
all right well this thing becomes this

505
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:25,130
整个事情在这里变成1比1加e到负beta e减去mu 
whole thing here becomes 1 over 1 plus e
to the minus beta e minus mu that maybe

506
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:29,780
采取了两个步骤，但是您可以代数检查这是正确的
took two steps but but you can check
algebraically that's true and again

507
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:35,450
我们将假设类似于我有更多空间的东西
we're going to assume something
analogous to what do I have more space

508
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:41,030
某个地方可能没有，也许我不是，所以我们要假设一些事情
somewhere no all right maybe I don't so
we're going to assume something

509
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:47,480
类似于我们对电子的假设，将假设化学物质
analogous to what we assumed for the
electrons will assume that the chemical

510
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:55,490
电位不太接近太接近太近意味着内部
potential is not too close too close too
close meaning within the within the

511
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:59,990
在价带顶部的KBT范围内的温度
temperature within a range of KBT of the
top of the valence band

512
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:08,080
 evie在这种情况下，可以将此事物近似为整个事物
evie in which case this thing can be
approximated as this whole thing here

513
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:13,100
可以近似等于βepsilon的玻尔兹曼因子e 
can be approximately equal to the
Boltzmann factor e to the beta epsilon

514
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:21,560
减去亩少于1好吧，所以还是差不多
minus mu of much less than 1 okay so
it's again more or less the same the

515
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,740
同样的故事，但在这里您必须意识到能量更少
same story but here
you have to realize that energy is less

516
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,690
比起您，您正在整个激活价带向下
than you and you're activating a whole
downwards into the valence band rather

517
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,900
而不是电子进入导带
than a electron up into the conduction
band

518
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:39,950
因此插入价带状态密度的表达式
so plugging in the expression for the
density of states of the valence band

519
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:47,180
我们得到了一个三分之二的pi平方H形立方体的星洞
we get to I'm a star hole to the
three-halves to pi squared H bar cubed

520
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,799
积分D能量减去无穷大至可见性
integral D energy minus infinity to
evince

521
00:48:51,799 --> 00:49:01,609
 e价减去e的1/2 e减去mu并完全相同
e valence minus e the 1/2 e to the beta
epsilon minus mu and exactly the same

522
00:49:01,609 --> 00:49:09,529
我认为在各个地方可能都带有几个减号的操纵
manipulations with maybe a couple minus
signs put in in various places I think

523
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:12,529
你应该做功课，所以也许我不会经历，而且我
you're supposed to do it for homework so
maybe I won't go through it and also I'm

524
00:49:12,529 --> 00:49:16,430
真的提前了，所以整个事情在一天结束时变得非常
really ahead of time so this whole thing
becomes at the end of the day a very

525
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:27,650
与上面发现的类似表达是PI上1/4-M星整个KBT 
analogous expression to what we found
above is 1/4 - M star whole KBT over PI

526
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:36,670
 H bar减去负数mu的均方根为e的三分之二。 
H bar squared all to three-halves e to
the minus beta mu minus e valence and

527
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:42,529
同样，您在这里有一些前置因素，但重要的是
again it's the same story you have some
pre factors here but the important part

528
00:49:42,529 --> 00:49:48,170
是您必须激活从化学势到
is that you have to activate a hole down
from the chemical potential into the

529
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,670
价带，因为它需要能量才能将一个孔推入价
valence band because it takes energy to
push on a hole down into the valence

530
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:56,539
带孔要尽可能多地上升，所以如果我们知道化学物质
band the holes want to go up as much as
possible so if we knew the chemical

531
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:01,039
势，我们知道温度，我们可以算出密度
potential and we knew the temperature we
could figure out the density of

532
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,390
导带中的电子和价带中的空穴密度
electrons in the conduction band and the
density of holes in the valence band but

533
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:11,059
现在有一个诀窍，诀窍是看T的n乘以P的乘积
now there's a trick and the trick is to
look at the product of n of T times P of

534
00:50:11,059 --> 00:50:22,039
这样做，我们得到了很多因素，因此比PI H高出1/2 KB 
T let's do that we get a bunch of
factors so 1/2 out front KB T over PI H

535
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:29,450
正方形的立方，然后有一个质量为整个恒星的电子恒星- 
bar squared cubed then there's a mass of
an electron star mass of whole star -

536
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:33,380
三分之二，然后看一下指数因子，您会发现
three-halves and then if you look at the
exponential factors you'll notice that

537
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,400
负beta Muse的指数因子e和正beta mu的指数因子
the exponential factors e to the minus
beta Muse and the e to the plus beta mu

538
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,160
将取消，因此剩下的唯一东西是e到负beta e 
will cancel so the only thing that's
left over is e to the minus beta e

539
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,620
传导-有效eeeek诱导-e价是egapp，所以
conduction - avail
eeeek induction - e valence is egapp so

540
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,610
如果您知道间隙能量并且知道温度，那么您将知道
if you know the gap energy and you know
the temperature you know the product of

541
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,840
导带中的电子数和空穴数
the number of electrons in the
conduction band and the number of holes

542
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:05,330
在价带中，这条法则非常重要，被称为上帝
in the valence band and this this law
very important law is known as God is

543
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:15,050
如果您与化学家交谈，则被称为质量作用定律。 
known as the law of mass action law of
mass action if you talk to chemists they

544
00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:18,800
知道这是他们的集体行动法则，因此命名法
know this they have a law of mass action
and the nomenclature comes from this

545
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,180
从化学上来说，实际上我可能不会讲究为什么它被称为相同
from chemistry actually I won't maybe go
through why it is it's called the same

546
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,870
是化学中的质量作用定律，但这里很重要
thing as the law of mass action in
chemistry but the important thing here

547
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:30,830
要意识到的是，该产品与化学势无关
to realize is that the product is
independent of the chemical potential

548
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:36,200
这意味着它与我们掺杂系统的方式无关，所以让我们
and that means it's independent of how
we've doped the system so let's a couple

549
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,610
如果我们有一个内在的话，还有更多的事情哦
more things if we have an intrinsic Oh
did I use that word I never use that

550
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:50,120
这样的本征之前的单词表示没有掺杂，所以如果我有本征半导体
word before so intrinsic means undoped
so if I have an intrinsic semiconductor

551
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:55,190
我应该在上一堂课中用那个词来表示内在的
I should have probably used that that
word in last lecture for an intrinsic

552
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,970
半导体导带中电子的密度等于
semiconductor the density of electrons
in the conduction band equals the

553
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:02,480
价带中空穴的密度，因为每次带电子时
density of holes in the valence band
because each time you take an electron

554
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,140
在价带之外，将其放在导带中，创建一个孔
out of the valence band you put it up in
the conduction band you created one hole

555
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:10,190
并创造了一个电子，在这种情况下，您只需取
and created one electron in which case
you can just take the square root of the

556
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:15,170
的质量定律，你可以知道在任何温度下N和P分别是多少
law of mass action and you can tell what
N and P are at any temperature so you're

557
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:24,350
那里很好，但是对于掺杂的掺杂系统，则更复杂，然后我们添加
good there but for a doped system doped
then it's more complicated then we add

558
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:33,350
掺杂物，我们在导带中的电子数为负
dopants and we have the number of
electrons in the conduction band minus

559
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,380
价带中的空穴数等于施主杂质的数目
the number of holes in the valence band
equals the number of donor impurities

560
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:47,380
杂质减去受体杂质数量
impurities minus the number of acceptor
impurities

561
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:55,400
因为基本上每次您添加施主杂质时，您都会向其中添加一个电子
because basically each time you add a
donor impurity you add one electron into

562
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,890
导带不每次都在价带上加一个孔
the conduction band without adding a
hole into the valence band on each time

563
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,740
您添加一个受体，在价带中添加一个孔，而不添加一个
you add an acceptor you add a hole into
the valence band without adding an

564
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:13,040
电子进入导带，只要T是
electron into the conduction band and
this is true as long as as long as T is

565
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:20,660
大于T冻结，其中导带中的电子
greater than T freeze-out where the
electrons in the conduction band gets

566
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:26,060
绑定到他们的供体上，价带中的空洞被绑定到
get bound to their donors and the holes
in the in the valence band get bound to

567
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:32,180
他们的受体，所以这里要意识到的关键是N的乘积
their acceptors so the key thing to
realize here is that the product of N

568
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,770
并且P是固定的，与掺杂无关，n NP的差异取决于
and P is fixed independent of the doping
the difference of n NP depends on the

569
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:43,099
掺杂意味着在添加电子时会添加施主杂质
doping this means that as you add
electrons as you add donor impurities

570
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:48,619
化学势上升，所以您获得更多的电子和更少的空穴，但是
the chemical potential goes up so you
get more electrons and fewer holes but

571
00:53:48,619 --> 00:53:51,980
电子数乘无数的乘积保持不变
the product of the number of electrons
numberless holes stays fixed as you add

572
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,630
更多的受体化学势下降，您得到的空洞比
more acceptors the chemical potential
goes down you get more holes than

573
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:59,540
电子，但两者的乘积保持固定，也许我什至会写
electrons but the product of the two
stays fixed maybe I'll even write that

574
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:11,150
在叫停之前，先增加捐助者，然后亩增加亩。 
before calling it quits
adding donors mu goes up mu goes up

575
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:21,589
我们添加了接受器，接受器的mu下降了，但是由于质量定律
we're adding acceptors acceptors mu goes
down but because of the law of mass

576
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:26,630
行动这两个的乘积总是会保持固定，所以
action the product of those two is
always going to stay fixed all right so

577
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,599
下次我们会去讨论一些真正的半导体
next time we'll pick up and actually
talk about some real semiconductor

578
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,770
设备和改变世界的设备，例如晶体管，我会看到
devices and the devices that change the
world like the transistor and I'll see

579
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,190
你我认为星期三是星期三我认为是星期三好
you I think Wednesday is Wednesday
I think it's Wednesday okay have a good

580
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:41,130
周末你
weekend
you
