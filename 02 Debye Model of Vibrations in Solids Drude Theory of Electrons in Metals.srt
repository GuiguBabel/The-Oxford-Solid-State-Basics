1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,950
好的，这是凝聚态课程的第二讲欢迎回来
okay this is the second lecture of the
condensed matter course welcome back

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,560
在第一次演讲后我们开始一群人之前的三件事
three quick things before we start a
bunch of people after the first lecture

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,769
问我这本书的标题是什么，以便他们可以在书店找到它
asked me what's the title of the book so
they can find it in the bookstore it's

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,240
牛津固态基础知识现在您可以找到它，这是我想要的第二件事
the Oxford solid state basics now you
can find it the second thing I want to

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,470
鼓励您使用留言板没人用过但还是有人勇敢
encourage you to use the message board
no one's used it yet someone be brave

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,289
发布第一条消息后，我保证您会发现它有用
post the first message once you get
going I promise you'll find it useful

7
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:26,519
第三件事，如果有任何问题，我上次强调的不够
the third thing I didn't emphasize this
enough last time if there's any problems

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,689
与课程中的任何错误错别字和作业设置书中的错别字
with the course any sort of error typos
and the homework sets typos in the book

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,870
我说的话如果在演讲中有误，请立即来找我
anything I say if it seems wrong in
lecture please come to me immediately

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,860
我可以发布更正，因此无法让所有人知道
and I can issue corrections and
therefore not get everyone is you know

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,219
尽可能让我们感到困惑，所以您只知道在
confused as much as we can so just you
know either post a message on the

12
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,030
留言板发送电子邮件演讲后抓住我，是的，我知道这很疯狂
message board send the email catch me
after lecture or yeah I know it's crazy

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:54,480
但你还是可以打给我，所以上次我们停下来谈话时
but you can call me maybe yeah anyway so
last time we we left off we were talking

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:05,220
关于固体的热容量，我们从玻尔兹曼图片开始
about heat capacity of solids and we
started with the Boltzmann picture of a

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:11,760
固体和Volta Mons图片两个月的图片都是固体中的原子
solid and Volta Mons picture both month
picture was that an atom in a solid

16
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
应该被认为是坐在谐波振荡器的底部
should be thought of as sitting in the
bottom of a harmonic oscillator

17
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,380
来回摆动，他能够从中得出定律
oscillating back and forth and from that
picture he was able to derive the law of

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,290
做一个小原子的小热容量是3 Kb，除了
do long petit heat capacity per atom is
3 Kb it's pretty good result except it

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,400
在低温下固体热容下降的情况不一致
didn't agree at low temperature where
the heat capacity of solids drops

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,979
爱因斯坦弄清楚发生了什么，他增加了量子力学，并且由于
Einstein figured out what was going on
he added quantum mechanics and due to

21
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,970
量子力学谐波振荡器的能级得到量化
quantum mechanics the energy levels of
the harmonic oscillator to get quantized

22
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,799
当温度降至量化能量以下时，振荡器得到
and when the temperature drops below the
quantization energy the oscillator gets

23
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,299
冻结了基态，热容下降了C 
frozen his ground state and the heat
capacity drops C drops at low

24
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,990
温度在低T下下降，他的预测是温度应该下降
temperature drops at low T and his
prediction was it should drop

25
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:03,210
他的热容量理论成指数地拟合数据
exponentially exponentially his theory
of heat capacity fit the data pretty

26
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,799
很好，的确可以预测低温下的热容下降，但是
well and indeed it predicted this drop
of heat capacity at low temperature but

27
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,320
不幸的是实验说实验说低温
unfortunately experiment said experiment
said that at low temperature the heat

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,020
容量与T的立方成正比，且不呈指数下降，因此
capacities are proportional to T cubed
not dropping exponentially so that

29
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:27,400
带我们到今天的主题，如果我是1912年，那就是鸿沟
brings us to the subject of today which
is the divide if I was 1912 and the

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,050
直觉是你不能把固体看作是一堆原子
devised intuition was that you cannot
think of a solid as a bunch of atoms in

31
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,400
我们心脏的底部谐波很好，因为当一个原子移动时，它确实会
the bottom of our heart harmonic well
because when one atom moves it does get

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,520
被邻居推回原来的位置，但在此过程中
pushed back to its original position by
its neighbor but in the process it

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,830
推它的邻居，然后他的邻居推它的邻居，所以
pushes its neighbor and then his
neighbors pushes its neighbor and so

34
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,800
等等等等，实际上我们应该在想什么
forth and so on
so in fact what we should be thinking

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:53,430
固体中的振动实际上是波，尤其是
about is the vibration in a solid is
actually a wave and in particular

36
00:02:53,430 --> 00:03:00,730
振动波已经响起，现在已经知道了如何
vibrational waves are sound now
something was already known about how

37
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,930
波一直在量子力学的影响下一直返回
waves behave under the influence of
quantum mechanics all the way back in

38
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,820
 1899年，马克斯·普朗克（Max Planck）完成了黑体辐射的计算， 
1899 Max Planck had done this black body
radiation calculation and when when Max

39
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,940
普朗克做了这个计算，他实际上不知道自己在做什么，他没有
Planck did this calculation he actually
had no idea what he was doing he didn't

40
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,600
甚至就像他在做什么一样，他说那是完全绝望的行为
even like what he was doing he said it
was a act of complete despair never

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,320
我真的很喜欢这个计算，但是十三年后，人们开始
really liked the calculation very much
but thirteen years later people started

42
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,800
了解有关量子力学和小子的一点点知识
to understand little bits and pieces
about quantum mechanics and plunks

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,890
原始的计算似乎更有意义
original calculations seem to make a lot
more sense

44
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:30,760
所以德拜认为我们应该做的就是量化声波
so Debye thought that what we should do
is we should quantize the sound waves

45
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:41,830
就像光一样，一般的想法是你知道这是现代的
just like light like light the general
idea is you know this is in modern

46
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:44,709
你知道朋克的语言不明白这一点，但我们明白
language you know plunk didn't
understand this but but we understand

47
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,540
现在来自爱因斯坦的工作，我们知道给定振荡器的能量
this now is from Einsteins work we know
that the energy of a given oscillator

48
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:57,040
将是H bar Omega乘以玻色系数βH bar Omega加上零
would be H bar Omega times the bose
factor beta H bar Omega plus the zero

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,370
点能量加上一半，所以如果我们有你知道的图片
point energy plus one half and so if we
have the the picture that the you know

50
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,890
我们现在解释普朗克，而我们所理解的是每个波动模式
of we interpret Planck as now and what
do by understood is that each wave mode

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,950
在米特尼克（Mitnick）的盒子里，将材料放在盒子里
in a box in a Mitnick you put your
material in a box

52
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:16,540
那个盒子里的每一波都应该当作振荡器，所以总的
each wave one in that box should be
treated as an oscillator so the total

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,550
盒子内的总能量e是所有波动模式的总和
energy e total inside your box is the
sum over all wave modes

54
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:32,289
该模式下的H-bar Omega乘以Lois factor beta H-bar的Omega 
of h-bar Omega for that mode times Lois
factor beta H bar Omega for the mode

55
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:37,639
加1/2，您要做的就是对框中所有模式求和
plus 1/2 and all you have to do is sum
over all the modes in the box now the

56
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,979
原因这会给你带来不同于爱因斯坦的东西
reason this is going to give you
something different from what Einstein

57
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:44,180
曾经是因为每当您在框中有很多模式时，其中一些
had was because whenever you have a
bunch of modes in the box some of those

58
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,409
模式将是低温低能耗模式或低频模式
modes are going to be low temperature
low energy modes or low frequency modes

59
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:53,720
因此在爱因斯坦的计算中，当温度降至低于频率
so in Einstein's calculation when the
temperature dropped below the frequency

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,099
振荡器的热容量下降，但这里的想法是我们有一个
of the oscillator then the heat capacity
dropped but the idea here is we have a

61
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:01,879
框内模式中频率的整体分布，因此当降低
whole distribution of frequencies in the
modes in our box and so as we lower the

62
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:06,590
温度总是会有一些频率足够低的模式
temperature there will always be some
modes of low enough frequency that will

63
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,129
仍然有一些热容量，所以热容量不会下降
still have some heat capacity left so
the heat capacity won't drop

64
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:15,259
我们在低温下呈指数增长，这就是现在的直觉
exponentially as we go to low
temperature so that's the intuition now

65
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,120
朋克的所作所为和德拜的所作所为之间会有一些差异
there's going to be some differences
between what plunk did and what Debye

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,860
这样做是因为光在许多方面明显不同于声音，一种方式是
did because light is obviously different
from sound in many ways one way is that

67
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,930
光比声音快很多
light is of course a lot faster than
sound

68
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,909
但这只是数量上的差异，还有一些定性
but that's only sort of a quantitative
difference there's some more qualitative

69
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:35,060
我们将要处理的差异，特别是其中之一
differences that we're going to have to
deal with and one in particular

70
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:46,699
光与声音的区别在于光具有两种极化
light versus sound is that light has two
polarizations polarizations and sound

71
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:54,889
现在有三极分化，您会从enm记住，如果有一盏灯
has three polarizations now you'll
remember from your enm that if a light

72
00:05:54,889 --> 00:05:58,909
是x方向的电磁波或电磁波
wave is or an electromagnetic wave of
any sort is going in the x direction the

73
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,199
电场必须在Y方向或Z方向上
electric field has to be in the Y
direction or the Z direction it can't be

74
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,460
如果在X方向上有声波，则X方向的声音就不会像
in the X direction sound is not like
that if a sound wave is going in the X

75
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,449
声波的极化方向可以是任何方向
direction the polarization of the sound
wave can be in any direction let me show

76
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:15,529
您可能最容易用电影解释这一点，所以让我向您展示
you it's probably easiest to explain
this with a movie so let me show you the

77
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:20,139
我所说的电影，这就是所谓的纵波
movie of what I mean by this this is
what's known as a longitudinal wave

78
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,009
这意味着原子在相同方向上来回运动
which means that the atoms are moving
back and forth in the same direction

79
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,509
波浪实际上正在前进，因此波浪正在X方向运动，并且
that the wave is actually going so the
wave is going the X direction and the

80
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,729
原子在X方向上来回移动，因此不会发生
atoms are moving back and forth in the X
direction so this doesn't occur for

81
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,089
光为光波在x方向上移动
light for light
the wave is going the x-direction the

82
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,989
电磁场始终指向z方向的y方向
electromagnetic field is always pointing
in the y direction of the z direction

83
00:06:40,989 --> 00:06:46,309
与光更相似的是所谓的横波，其中光是
more similar to light is what's known as
a transverse wave where the light is

84
00:06:46,309 --> 00:06:50,149
好在波向X方向传播的地方，但是原子实际上是
good where the wave is going in the X
direction but the atoms are actually

85
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:55,699
可以在Y方向或Z方向上来回移动
moving back and forth in the Y direction
or the Z direction okay so with sound

86
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,459
实际上，原子可以移动三个极化
you can actually have three
polarizations the atoms can be moving in

87
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,899
任意方向，而光只能指向两个方向
any direction whereas light the electric
field has to point in only two possible

88
00:07:02,899 --> 00:07:09,169
方向是明确的，是的，很好，所以我们必须跟踪
directions is that clear yeah okay good
so we're gonna have to keep track of the

89
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:15,289
事实上，我们对光有三种极化，而对树液只有两种极化
fact that we have three polarizations
for light and only two for sap the way

90
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:19,309
声音的三个极化，光的只有两个极化
around three polarization for sound and
only two for light there's a couple of

91
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:23,569
我们还将做的事情将是近似的
things we're gonna also do which are
going to be approximations which are

92
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:29,989
使我们的生活更简单的一个是，我们将假设速度
going to make our life simpler one is
that we're going to assume the velocity

93
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:38,749
声音V的声音与拉深的极化无关，这是
of sound V sound is independent of
polarization in depth of pull this is

94
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:44,539
实际上并非如此，几乎总是横向模式会更慢
not actually true in reality almost
always the transverse mode is slower it

95
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:49,399
速度比纵向模式低，但实际上不是
has a lower velocity than the
longitudinal mode but it's actually not

96
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,239
要正确地处理它要复杂得多，但是您不会学到很多东西
so much more complicated to treat this
properly but you don't learn a whole lot

97
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:56,360
做得更好，我认为本书中有一项练习
more from doing it more properly I think
there's an exercise in the book that

98
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,419
要求您做得更正确，但我们将假设所有声音
asks you to do it more properly but
we're just going to assume all sound

99
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,559
波浪具有相同的速度，而与它们是否
waves have the same same velocity
independent of whether they're

100
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,149
纵向或横向，只要我们假设不是
longitudinal or transverse as long as
we're assuming things which are not

101
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:14,469
真的正确，我们还可以假设V声音与方向无关
really correct we might as well assume V
sound is independent of direction of

102
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,159
经常不正确的方向也经常
direction
which is often not true also frequently

103
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,939
当您拥有真正的固体时，声音的速度取决于
when you have a real solid the speed of
sound depends on which direction the

104
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,219
当然，我们将在本学期稍后再讨论这一点，但
solid you're going we'll discuss that a
little bit more later on in the term but

105
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:30,679
再说一遍，如果您更正确地对待它，那不是很多
again it's something that if you treat
it more properly it's not that much

106
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:34,729
更努力，您不会从中学到很多东西，所以我们不会做
harder and you don't learn so much more
from doing it so we're not going to do

107
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:38,958
它更合适，但请记住，我们正在做出这些近似值
it more properly but just keep in mind
that we are making these approximations

108
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:44,569
现在，如果您还记得去年所做的小节计算
now if you remember back to plunks
calculation which you did last year

109
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:48,920
您要担心的第一件事是计算一个盒子中的所有模式
the first thing you had to worry about
was counting all of the modes in a box

110
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,040
听起来有点熟悉，我们会去吗
does that sound familiar
a little bit familiar we're gonna go

111
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,770
再次通过它，因为它很重要，我们将使用很多
through that again because it's
important and we're gonna use a lot of

112
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,210
这个机制很多是今年要做很多其他事情，所以值得
the a lot of the mechanism is to do many
other things this year so it's worth

113
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:04,910
通过，所以这在计数盒子中的波浪数上有点
going through so this is a little aside
on counting waves in a box counting

114
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:14,660
波浪模式我猜框模式，所以这很难从一维开始
waves modes I guess modes in box so this
is hard to start with a one dimensional

115
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:20,660
 box 1d box，让我们在这里画一个一维的盒子
box 1d box so let's draw the one
dimensional box here it is it has some

116
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:27,140
长度L，我们可以在硬壁边界的盒子中写下波浪
length L we can write down a wave in
that box with hard wall boundary

117
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,260
您知道，L的条件和PI x在两端都变为0，这是因为
conditions and PI x over L as you know
comes to 0 at both ends because of the

118
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,770
硬壁边界条件，这是写下来的完美好方法
hard wall boundary conditions and this
is a perfectly good way to write down

119
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,980
框中每个不同的正整数n的波动n都不同
the waves in the box for every different
positive integer n you have a different

120
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,330
 wave模式还可以，但不是我们要做的是我们要做的
wave mode that's okay but it's not not
what we're gonna do what we're gonna do

121
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,570
相反，我们将使用所谓的周期性边界条件
is instead we're going to use what's
known as periodic boundary conditions

122
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,589
您可能在去年讨论了周期性边界条件
you may have discussed this last year
periodic boundary conditions boundaries

123
00:09:56,589 --> 00:10:05,440
也称为天生冯卡门边界条件天生冯卡曼卡门卡门
also known as born von-karman boundary
conditions born von Karman Carmen Carmen

124
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,210
出生是马克思的其中之一出生是量子力学的创造者之一
born was one of the Max born was one of
the creators of quantum mechanics and

125
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:15,680
西奥多·冯·卡曼曾是非常重要的数学家，马克斯·博恩也很
Theodore von Karman was a very important
mathematician Max Born is also very

126
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,589
很重要，因为他是奥利维亚·牛顿·约翰的祖父，她是
significant because he was Olivia
newton-john's grandfather she's an

127
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,010
重要的流行歌星，如果您不认识她，她对我这一代人很重要
important pop star if you don't know her
she was important for my generation at

128
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,950
无论如何，这样的话人们对我的印象并不足够深刻
any rate so anyway people don't see me
sufficiently impressed by that statement

129
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,940
是的，实际上还是可以的，所以周期性边界条件的想法是
it's it's actually it's anyway ok so the
idea of a periodic boundary condition is

130
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:36,530
我们要取长为L的盒子，然后将其包裹成一个圆圈
we're gonna take our box of length L and
we're going to wrap it up into a circle

131
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,110
 L的周长，然后我们将测量X 
of circumference L then we're gonna
measure X going around the box in this

132
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,510
这样的方式，我们之所以这样做，是因为一旦我们这样做， 
way like that and the reason we're doing
this is because once we do this the

133
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:52,430
波浪可以采用e到ikx的形式，我们不必处理正弦波， 
waves can take the form e to the ikx we
don't have to work with sines and

134
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:57,740
余弦如果我们在一个圆上有一个周期框，则可以使用指数的
cosines if we have a periodic box in a
circle we can use Exponential's and if

135
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,459
到现在为止，您还没有学过指数只是
you haven't learned already by this time
in your career Exponential's are just a

136
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:05,850
现在，当我们编写一个符号时，使用符号和共同符号要容易得多
lot easier to work with
signs and co-signs now when we write a

137
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:12,510
向ikx挥动e，我们必须要小心一点，因为坐标X和
wave e to the ikx we have to be a little
bit careful because the coordinate X and

138
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:18,180
 X到L的坐标实际上是相同的坐标（如果走了L的距离） 
the coordinate X plus L are actually the
same coordinate if you go a distance L

139
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,460
在盒子周围，您会回到完全相同的点，因此该波形
around the the box you get back to
exactly the same point so this wave form

140
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,570
无论是插入X还是x加L都必须完全相同，所以我们最好有您
must be exactly the same whether we plug
in X or x plus L so we better have you

141
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,560
知道这是否有意义，我们最好让ikx的e等于e 
know if this is going to make sense we
better have e to the ikx equal to e to

142
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:45,810
 IKX加L ok，否则i KS的e等于1或K必须为2 PI 
the I K X plus L ok or otherwise e to
the i KS to equal 1 or K has to be 2 PI

143
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:51,090
在L上乘以整数N，该整数可以是正数或负数，或者
over L times an integer N and that
integer can be positive or negative or

144
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:56,970
是我们喜欢的东西，到目前为止，每个人都满意
is whatever we like ok
everyone happy with that so far so good

145
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:05,460
好的，这意味着允许之间的间隔
ok so this means that the spacing
between allowed between between allowed

146
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:15,360
允许的国际象棋国际象棋是2 PI，超过L ll是我们循环的周长， 
allowed Ches Ches is 2 PI over L ll
being the circumference of our loop and

147
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,910
特别是如果我们必须对所有k求和，我们可以替换该总和
in particular if we ever have to sum
over all the k's we can replace that sum

148
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:27,360
通过积分衰减乘以2 pi的L倍，您是否经历过
by an integral decay times a factor of L
over 2 pi did you go through this

149
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,490
去年的争论有点不错，好吧，我们将大量使用它
argument last year a little bit yes well
ok we're going to use it an awful lot

150
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,220
今年，这就是为什么我要再次经历它，因为它很重要
this year so that's why I'm going
through it again because it's important

151
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:42,300
现在我们当然不是生活在一个维度中，所以我们必须考虑
now we of course don't live in one
dimension so we have to think as

152
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,120
多维的人，我们必须在多个维度进行思考，因此在3D中
multi-dimensional people we have to
think in multiple dimensions so in 3d

153
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:56,580
我们要乘L乘L乘L乘L 
we're gonna take an L by L by L periodic
box photic box and at this point you

154
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:01,470
可能会开始有点不高兴，因为没有L 
might start to be a little bit upset
because there's no such thing as an L by

155
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,060
在现实世界中，L到L的周期性盒子必须有一个盒子
L by L periodic box in the real world
you would have to have a box for which

156
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,720
如果您在任何方向上走了L距离，您都会回到正确的位置
if you went a distance L in any
direction you came back to exactly where

157
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,870
您从三个维度入手，您无法构建这样的东西，他们只是没有
you started in three dimensions you
can't build such a thing they just don't

158
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,889
存在，所以为什么要这样做，尽管重点是
exist so why is it we're going to do
this though the point is

159
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:20,850
实际上，对于系统边界几乎做什么都不重要
doesn't actually matter what you do with
the boundaries of your system for almost

160
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,809
您实际上对计算感兴趣的任何数量，例如热容量
any quantity you're actually interested
in calculating such as the heat capacity

161
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:28,769
您可以在一个很小的区域内进行本地测量
it's something that you could measure
locally just in a small region of the

162
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:31,709
实际的物理系统，所以对
actual physical system so it doesn't
matter what you would do with the

163
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,850
边界可能非常远，因此您可以使用硬墙边界
boundaries which could be very very far
away so you can use hard wall boundary

164
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,699
您可以使用周期性边界条件您可以使用任何其他类型的条件
conditions you can use periodic boundary
conditions you can use any other type of

165
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:42,480
边界条件对我们来说很方便，使用它们很方便
boundary condition which is convenient
and for us it's convenient to use these

166
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,199
周期性边界条件，我们将摆脱它的原因是
periodic boundary conditions and we're
going to get away with it the reason we

167
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,749
想要使用这些周期性边界条件是因为
want to use these periodic boundary
conditions is because then the waves

168
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:54,600
看起来像Evi K矢量点X矢量，它是指数的
will look like Evi K vector dot X vector
it's an exponential Exponential's are

169
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,259
易于合作，这就是为什么我们在每个仍然开心的人中都这样做
easy to work with and that's why we're
doing it everyone that's still happy

170
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:05,069
很好，所以在三个维度上，K必须是L倍的2 PI 
with that okay good so in three
dimensions K has to be 2 PI over L times

171
00:14:05,069 --> 00:14:13,949
整数和x + y + Z，因此，如果我们对K个向量求和，则可以替换
integers and x + y + Z and so if we ever
have a sum over K vectors we can replace

172
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:22,980
 L与2 PI乘以积分DK X积分DK y积分的总和
that sum with L over 2 PI cubed times
the integral DK X integral DK y integral

173
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,139
 DK Z或我们通常会写的另一种方式将写为
DK Z or another way that we will most
usually write this will write this as

174
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:37,559
系统的体积乘以2个PI立方上的积分d 3k，我们将得到
the volume of the system times the
integral d 3k over 2 PI cubed and we'll

175
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:43,169
看到这个因子体积积分D 3k超过2 PI的立方，可能会看到它a 
see this factored volume integral D 3k
over 2 PI cubed probably see it a

176
00:14:43,169 --> 00:14:47,279
在我们还没做好之前，今年有一百次，所以我们要做的是
hundred times this year before we're
done okay so what we're going to do is

177
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,959
我们将使用刚刚学到的关于对盒中的波进行计数的知识来应用
we're going to use what we just learned
about counting waves in a box to apply

178
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,429
这里的方程式，所以这里有一些超模
to this equation here so there's some
over modes here I then write sum over

179
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:04,019
模式将成为我们模式中所有可能的K向量的总和，但是
modes is going to become the sum over
all possible K vectors for our modes but

180
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,579
然后乘以因子3，因子3来自三个极化
then times a factor of 3 and the factor
of 3 is from the three polarizations we

181
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,199
可以有一个纵向或两个横向极化，然后这个
can have one longitudinal or two
transverse polarizations and then this

182
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,789
总而言之，我们将在这里使用该定律将其转换为整数，所以现在我们
sum we're going to use this law here to
convert it into an integral so now we

183
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:28,829
自从我们有了3个2 PI的体积积分后，体积积分d 3k的三个因子
have three factor of the volume integral
d 3k over 2 PI cubed now since we've

184
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:33,090
在这里假设一切都是各向同性的
assumed over here
everything is isotropic and in other

185
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,410
单词速度与方向无关，我们可以采用这三个
words velocities are independent of
direction we can then take this three

186
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:42,660
维笛卡尔积分并将其转换为球极积分，所以我们
dimensional Cartesian integral and turn
it into a spherical polar integral so we

187
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:49,410
有三倍的体积，让我们在这里拉出2个PI立方体，然后
have three times the volume let's pull
out the 2 PI cubed here and then we have

188
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:57,420
熟悉的从0到无穷大的整数4 pi K平方DK 
integral 4 pi K squared
DK from 0 to infinity as this familiar

189
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:02,310
 4 pi是球形方向上的积分是3 aqua极性
the 4 pi is the integral over the
spherical directions yes 3 aqua polar

190
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:06,900
因为我们正在考虑声音，所以最终协调每个人对此感到满意
coordinates everyone's happy with that
finally since we're thinking about sound

191
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,650
您去年或去年在流体课程中可能学到的声音
for sound you've probably learned in
your fluids course last year or last

192
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:16,440
最后一项频率与波矢成正比
last term frequency is proportional to
the wave vector and the proportionality

193
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:24,540
常数是声音的速度，所以我们只需要改变积分
constant is the velocity velocity of the
sound so let's just change that integral

194
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,100
变成一个积分的超频率，而不是积分的超波矢量，这样
into an integral over frequency instead
of an integral over wave vector so that

195
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,200
成为一些因素，让我们在楼上将4 pi取出
becomes a pull out some factors here
let's pull out a 4 pi upstairs we have a

196
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:40,110
 2 PI楼下立方体我想我们楼下有速度立方体，然后我们
2 PI cubed downstairs I guess we have
velocity cubed downstairs and then we

197
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:46,410
有一个整数0到无穷大的Omega平方D Omega，我要写
have an integral 0 to infinity Omega
squared D Omega and I'm going to write

198
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:55,980
那就是定义一个Omega D Omega 0到无穷大的数量G而这个G 
that as just defining a quantity G of
Omega D Omega 0 to infinity and this G

199
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,320
欧米茄（Omega）只是这些常数中的一小部分，我将坚持在一起
of Omega is just a bunch of those
constants I'm going to stick together so

200
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:08,910
我想我楼上有12 12 pi，楼下有2 PI我想我
I guess I have 12 12 pi upstairs and I
have 2 PI cubed downstairs I guess I

201
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:14,040
楼下有一个速度立方体，然后楼上有一个体积，我要
have a velocity cube downstairs and then
I have a volume upstairs and I'm gonna

202
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,760
以一种棘手的方式将音量写在楼上，我将其写为
write the volume upstairs in sort of a
tricky way I'm gonna write it as the

203
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,890
原子数除以楼下体积即密度，然后
number of atoms divided by the volume
downstairs that's the density and then

204
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,880
楼上的原子数会很方便，然后我需要
the number of atoms upstairs that's
going to be convenient and then I need

205
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:36,150
欧米茄平方欧米茄平方，所以这里的这个量称为
also that Omega squared Omega squared so
this quantity here is known as which I

206
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:40,890
把它放在这里欧米茄G被称为欧米茄G 
put it over here G of Omega is known as
G of Omega is

207
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:45,299
被称为国家密度，我认为您去年遇到了
known as the density of states and I
think you ran into this last year when

208
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:52,220
你做了黑体辐射，国家密度的想法是
you did blackbody radiation the idea of
a density of states is that it is

209
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:57,870
基本上，您在给定频率下有多少种这些模式
basically how many of these modes you
have at a given frequency in particular

210
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:12,770
 G Omega D Omega等于频率介于
G Omega D Omega equals number of modes
with frequency frequency between between

211
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:21,299
欧米茄（Omega）和欧米茄（Omega）加D欧米茄（Omega），因此，如果您想对
Omega and Omega plus D Omega so if you
want to sum over all the modes in the

212
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:25,080
系统，而不是仅汇总所有模式，而是集成
system instead of just summing all the
modes what you do is you integrate over

213
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,840
所有频率乘以每个频率下的模式数量
all frequencies times the number of
modes at each frequency okay sort of a

214
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,340
方便的做事方式实际上我也将简化一点
convenient way to do things I'm actually
also going to simplify this a little bit

215
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:40,470
通过定义另一个方便的数量，我将重写
further by defining another convenient
quantity I'm gonna rewrite this G of

216
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:47,730
欧米茄的Omega G，因为我要写出N个原子然后
Omega G of Omega as I'm gonna write it
as pull out the N number of atoms then

217
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:54,870
九个欧米茄平方超过欧米茄D立方，所以我将欧米茄D定义为立方
nine Omega squared over Omega D cubed so
I'm defining Omega D cubed here to be a

218
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,960
那些常数在一起的一堆Omega D立方是六倍平方平方倍
bunch of those constants stuck together
Omega D cubed is six pi squared times

219
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,250
体积密度乘以声音速度的密度，这称为
the density number over volume times
velocity of sound cubed this is known as

220
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:16,230
至少在目前，按频率划分的德比频率
the Debye frequency after mister du by
frequency and at least for now

221
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,260
我们只是将其视为我们拥有的一堆常数
we're just going to think of it as this
bunch of constants that we've

222
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,919
方便定义，因此写GI的意思会更容易
conveniently defined so it's easier to
write G I mean in a moment will give it

223
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:27,330
一个更重要的含义，但现在只是那些常数
a more important meaning but for now
it's just those bunch of constants okay

224
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:33,330
因此，完成所有这些操作之后，我们可以在顶部
so having done all of that we can then
weigh up there at the very top of the

225
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,360
板上，我们将能量表示为所有模式的总和
board we have the expression for the
energy as a sum over all of the modes so

226
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,919
实际上，也许我会把它放在这里，所以我不必将其滚动到
I'm actually maybe I'll put it over here
so I don't have to scroll that off the

227
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,510
最重要的一点，所以我们现在将能量总计
top of the board
so we'll now write the energy the total

228
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,100
在给定温度下的能量，而不是将其写为所有模式的总和
energy at a given temperature instead of
writing it as a sum over all the modes

229
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:57,200
我将把它写成等于频率的整数
I'm going to write it as an
integral over frequencies equals

230
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,410
从零到无穷大的积分D欧米茄G欧米茄是所有模式下的总和
integral D Omega from zero to infinity
G Omega that's the sum over all modes by

231
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,720
频率积分，我们想要积分的是H bar Omega 
integrating over frequency and the thing
that we want to integrate is H bar Omega

232
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:15,740
弓箭因子beta H栏欧米茄加一半好吧人们对此感到满意
bows factor beta H bar Omega plus
one-half okay people happy with that

233
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:23,030
我们正在做什么是是也许是好的好吧好吧，这就是表达
what we're doing yes yes maybe yeah okay
good all right so this is the expression

234
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:26,530
我们将尝试评估，如果您真的非常关注
that we're gonna try to evaluate and if
you're paying really close attention

235
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,610
你已经对我不高兴了，因为它实际上是无限的
you'll be upset with me
already because it's actually infinite

236
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,950
盒子中的总能量是无限的，之所以无限，是因为
this total energy in the box is infinite
and the reason it's infinite is because

237
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:42,140
加上一半的乘积，再看乘以一半的乘积
of this plus one-half look at what the
plus one-half multiplies it multiplies

238
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,400
欧米茄的Omega G因子与Omega平方成正比，所以它是
the factor Omega G of Omega is
proportional to Omega squared so it's

239
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,650
欧米茄从零到无穷大的立方积分
the integral of Omega cubed from zero to
infinity

240
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:52,900
那是无限的，所以你可能会认为这是一个问题
that's infinite so that's kind of it you
might think that's kind of a problem

241
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,120
实际上，它并没有因为他们不知道而去买或买东西
actually it didn't bother to buy or
plunk because they didn't know about

242
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,300
零点能量，所以他们从不写下这个加一半，但不是
zero-point energy so they never wrote
down this plus one-half but it's not

243
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:02,510
出于多种原因会困扰我们，这主要是因为它不会继续
gonna bother us either for a number of
reasons the main reason it's not going

244
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:06,920
困扰我们是因为它给了我们无限的数量，但这是无限的
to bother us is because it gives us an
infinite quantity but it's an infinite

245
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,280
与温度无关的数量是唯一的位置
quantity that's independent of
temperature the only place in this

246
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,240
我们要在一天结束时在此处表达温度的表达式
expression where temperature occurs is
right here at the end of the day we want

247
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,240
热容，是能量相对于温度的导数
heat capacity which is the derivative of
the energy with respect to temperature

248
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,570
所以我们将不得不根据温度来区分这件事
so we're gonna have to differentiate
this thing with respect to temperature

249
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,110
而1/​​2将会消失，因为它与温度无关，所以
and the 1/2 is going to go away because
it's temperature independent so it's

250
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,740
给我们无限但与温度无关的贡献，所以我们不会
giving us an infinite but temperature
independent contribution so we don't

251
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:31,310
稍等一下，我们会看到另一个原因
care about it actually in a few moments
we're gonna see another reason why we're

252
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:35,720
不会在意那1/2，但现在我们只知道它不会
not gonna care about that 1/2 but for
now we'll just realize it's not going to

253
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,530
改变我们对热容的表达吧
change our expression for the heat
capacity all right

254
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,050
所以现在我们可以将状态密度插入此方程式中，所以让我们
so now we can plug in the density of
states into this equation here so let's

255
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,260
这样做，我们得到9，我将拉起H栏
do that
so we get 9 and I'll pull up the H bar

256
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,460
从那边经过立方体的Omega 2 
from over there
there's Omega 2 by cubed here cubed

257
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,800
楼下，然后剩下的东西整合了来自
downstairs and then the thing we have
left to integrate integral D Omega from

258
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,340
 0到无穷大，楼上有一个欧米茄立方体，然后
0 to infinity
there's Omega cubed upstairs and then

259
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,420
 βH bar欧米茄的玻色因子e 
the bose factor e to the beta H bar
Omega

260
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:10,690
 -剩下的看起来有点丑陋，但是我们可以将其取整
- one is left that looks a little bit
ugly but we can take this integral we

261
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:16,060
可以通过写x等于beta H bar Omega来简化它，然后
can simplify it a little bit by writing
x equals beta H bar Omega and then the

262
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:23,710
积分在beta H条上变为1，是该积分的第四倍
integral turns into 1 over beta H bar to
the fourth times this integral integral

263
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:31,630
 DX从0到X的无穷大，将e立方化为X减1，我保证你没有人
DX from 0 to infinity of X cubed e to
the X minus 1 and I promise you no one

264
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,650
曾经要你评估这个积分，只是一些数字
is ever going to ask you to evaluate
this integral it's just some number the

265
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,570
这个数字恰好是PI到15的第四个，如果您真的想知道
number happens to be PI to the fourth
over 15 and if you really want to know

266
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,800
该数字来自您，它位于您知道的其中之一的附录中
where that number comes from you it's in
the you know appendix of one of the

267
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,160
本书的各个章节，当有人说您可以阅读本书的内容时，您是否讨厌它？ 
chapters of the book and don't you hate
it when someone says you can go read the

268
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,160
本书，但实际上并不是那么重要，它只是给了我们一些重要的信息
book but in fact it's not so important
it just gives us a number the important

269
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:57,160
事情是它给了我们一些已知的数字，因此我们可以将该数字放入并获得
thing is it gives us some known number
so we can put that number in and get the

270
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,990
最终结果是，盒子中的总能量为9，KBT为
end result that the energy the total
energy in the box is 9 and KBT to the

271
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:12,490
第四部分除以H bar欧米茄Debye立方倍乘以该因子部分的第四部分
fourth here divided by H bar Omega Debye
cubed times this factor part of the 4th

272
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:21,430
超过15很好，然后我们当然可以将其区分以获得热量
over 15 okay good and then of course we
can differentiate this to get the heat

273
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:34,110
热容量是DT，没关系，所以在H bar Omega 2 bi上为n KB KB T 
capacity heat capacity is de DT and ok
so it's n KB KB T over H bar Omega 2 bi

274
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:41,740
立方，然后我想12 PI到5的第四个PI让我们开始吧
cubed and then I guess 12 PI to the
fourth over 5 let's so that's the heat

275
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,460
能力，因此有几件事对此做出评论，这使得
capacity and so a couple of things to
comment about this it makes this

276
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,230
首先令人兴奋，它与T的立方成正比，就像by想要的
exciting first of all it's proportional
to T cubed just like the by wanted you

277
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,120
如预期那样获得热容量的T立方依赖关系
get the T cubed dependence of the heat
capacity as expected it shouldn't be

278
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,930
令人惊讶的是，您获得了T立方热容，因为您从
surprising that you get this T cubed
heat capacity because you remember from

279
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,860
您去年做的黑体辐射计算表明
the blackbody radiation calculation you
did last year that the energy of

280
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:07,690
辐射您计算的盒子中的波能量与T成正比
radiation the energy of waves in a box
that you calculated is proportional to T

281
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,840
到第四，你应该期望能量是第四的T 
to the fourth you should have expected
the energy to be T to the fourth and

282
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,350
然后您将其微分一次，就得到T的立方，这就是为什么Debye 
then you differentiate it once and you
get T cubed so this is why Debye

283
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,540
期望以相同的方式对待海浪
expected that by treating the waves the
same way

284
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:23,740
我们处理了辐射我们将得到T立方定律
we treated radiation we would get the T
cubed law furthermore there's something

285
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,820
这个公式真的很令人兴奋，那就是没有免费的
really exciting about this formula here
and that is that there's no free

286
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:31,240
参数记得当爱因斯坦进行计算时，他有这个频率
parameters remember when Einstein did
his calculation he had this frequency

287
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,680
这个爱因斯坦频率他不知道如何振荡的频率
this Einstein frequency the oscillator
frequency which he didn't know how to

288
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,890
提出这个频率，他只是将其适合实验以尝试使其达到目标
come up with this frequency he just fit
it to the experiment to try to make it

289
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,530
一切看起来都很不错，这里没有免费参数Omega Debye，这里的问题由
all look nice here there's no free
parameter Omega Debye here is fixed by

290
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,700
密度和声速，所以一切都固定在这里
the density and the sound velocity so
everything is fixed here and if and if

291
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,180
计算这个量，然后将其与低温热量进行比较
you calculate this quantity and you
compare it to low temperature heat

292
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,060
实际上大多数材料的容量都非常一致，但是
capacity of most materials it actually
actually agrees extremely well but

293
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,460
不幸的是，就像您知道您永远不会免费得到任何东西一样，我们仍然有
unfortunately like you know you never
get anything for free so we still have a

294
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:15,610
高T时的问题我们希望在N上做长C的定律是3 KB 
problem problem at high T we want the
law of do long Petite C over N is 3 KB

295
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,500
我们没有得到在所有温度下都得到T的立方，这就是
and we didn't get that we got T cubed at
all temperatures here and this is where

296
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,340
 BI不得不稍微挠一下脑袋，然后想我好吗
the BI had to actually scratch his head
a little bit and think okay what did I

297
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,190
如果您进行此计算，会偶然出错
do wrong
incidentally if you do this calculation

298
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,890
对于电磁辐射，真的是一直到第四能量的T 
for electromagnetic radiation it really
is T to the fourth energy all the way up

299
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:37,390
到任意高温，如您所知，我们知道
to arbitrarily high temperature where as
you know in a solid we know that the

300
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:40,510
固体在某些高温下的热容会给我们
heat capacity of the solid at some high
temperature is going to give us just

301
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:47,260
三个KB不会被T切丁，所以在这里我们必须偏离塞子
three KB it's not going to be T cubed so
here we have to deviate from plunks

302
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,040
计算中，我们必须做些不同于那次沉思的事情
calculation we have to do something
different from what it was that plunk

303
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:57,610
做到了，然后就明白了他错在哪里
did and plunk and the by understood that
where he was going wrong where he was

304
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:00,970
出问题了，您知道他必须考虑这3来自何处
going wrong you know he has to think
about where this 3 comes from where is

305
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:05,350
 3中的3来自原子可以在3中移动的事实
this 3 from the 3 comes from the fact
that the atom can move in three

306
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,950
每个原子向三个可能方向移动的方向
directions each atom moves in three
possible directions you can figure this

307
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:14,740
原子具有的3个自由度以及他有多少个自由度
3 degrees of freedom that the atom has
and how many degrees of freedom did he

308
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:20,460
在他的盒子里算好模式总数他算出的模式数
count in his box well the total number
of modes number of modes that he counted

309
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:26,980
他的从0到无穷大的积分G Omega D Omega和Omega G都和Omega一样
his integral from 0 to infinity G Omega
D Omega and G of Omega goes as Omega

310
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,460
平方，您将其集成到其中，并给您无限，所以他
squared you integrate that into
and that gives you infinity so he

311
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,390
数了无数的自由度，他说好吧，我是
counted an infinite number of degrees of
freedom and he said well wait I'm I

312
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,450
在盒子里计算了无数种模式，但是有有限数量的
counted an infinite number of modes in
the box but there's a finite number of

313
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,049
每个原子可以在三个方向上移动的自由度，不应有
degrees of freedom each atom can move in
three directions and there shouldn't be

314
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:46,160
盒子里的自由度远不止这些，所以我必须以某种方式解决这个问题
more than that many degrees of freedom
in my box so somehow I have to fix that

315
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:50,600
问题，使Box仅具有固定数量的自由度
problem and make the Box have only a
fixed number of degrees of freedom not

316
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:58,820
无限的自由度，所以他是怎么做到的
an infinite number of degrees of freedom
so how did he do that impose a cutoff so

317
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,650
他要做的是宣布一些截止频率的欧米茄
what he's going to do is he's going to
declare some frequency cutoff Omega

318
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:13,940
截止G Omega D Omega这样盒子里现在正好有三种n模式
cutoff G Omega D Omega such that there
are exactly three n modes in the box now

319
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:19,820
这是一个临时解决方案，有点怪异，所以他正在做的是
this is an ad-hoc solution and it's kind
of a little weird so what he's doing is

320
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:23,330
他是说我们将所有这些波动模式都放在一个盒子里，当您到达某个
he's saying we have all these wave modes
in a box and when you get to some a

321
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:28,040
称为截止频率的频率，高于该频率就没有波模
frequency known as the cutoff frequency
above that there are no more wave modes

322
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,210
离开时，您没有声音移动到高于该频率的位置，似乎不再是
left you have no sound moves above this
above this frequency anymore seems a

323
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,910
学期后期有点奇怪，我们会发现它可能不像
little strange later in the term we're
gonna see it's maybe not as strange as

324
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,750
我们以为是在那时，也许看起来有些奇怪，但他
we thought but at then at that time
maybe it seems a little odd but he's

325
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:41,450
无论如何都会这样做，所以无论如何我们都会跟随他， 
gonna do it anyway so we're gonna do
this anyway we're gonna follow him and

326
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:45,110
看看会发生什么我们要做的第一件事就是我们必须弄清楚这是什么
see what happens first thing we need to
do is we have to figure out what this

327
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:49,820
截止频率将是这样，它将恰好给我们三个n 
cutoff frequency is going to be such
it's going to give us exactly three n

328
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:56,210
模式，所以让我们很好地计算一下这个东西，然后将其插入Omega的G中
modes so let's calculate this thing well
plug in G of Omega so plug in G of Omega

329
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:03,130
在这里，有一个9，还有一个欧米茄2，由立方积分0到欧米茄截止
here so there's a nine and there's Omega
two by cubed integral 0 to Omega cutoff

330
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,990
欧米茄（Omega）平方D欧米茄（Omega），所以我只是在那儿插入了Omega的G，然后开始
Omega squared D Omega so I just plugged
in G of Omega there and then let's do

331
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:18,200
该积分，我们得到3，Omega切割成立方体，而Omega Debye切割成立方体，再见
that integral and we get 3 and Omega cut
off cubed over Omega Debye cubed goodbye

332
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,860
立方，我们希望它等于3 N，为了使它成为真，我们更好
cubed and we want this to equal 3 N and
in order for that to be true we better

333
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:34,460
选择欧米茄截止值等于欧米茄2双，这就是为什么我碰巧选择那些
choose Omega cutoff equal to Omega 2 bi
okay that's why I happen to choose those

334
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:39,799
如果Omega 2乘以Omega 2，则特定的常数是截止频率，如果
particular constants as being Omega 2 by
Omega 2 by is the cutoff frequency if

335
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:42,600
您以德拜频率切断模式
you cut off your modes at the Debye
frequency

336
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,809
仅计数比您拥有的德拜频率更低的频率的模式
only count modes at lower frequencies
than the Debye frequency you have

337
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:52,260
精确的3n模式好吧，所以现在我们要回到这个方程式
exactly 3n modes okay all right so now
we're gonna go back to this equation

338
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:58,890
在这里，我们现在将框内的总能量重写为
over here and we're going to rewrite the
total energy in the box now as the

339
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:05,039
积分计数模式从无穷大到现在只有Omega D by G 
integral counting up modes not to
infinity now up only up to Omega D by G

340
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,120
欧米茄，然后是玻色系数βH吧，欧米茄，然后再加上1/2零点
Omega and then the bose factor beta H
bar Omega and then plus 1/2 zero-point

341
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,159
能量，您会注意到，因为我们已经切断了许多模式
energy and you'll notice now because
we've cut off our number of modes this

342
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,690
项不再发散，它是一个有限的零点能量项，这使我们
term no longer diverges it's a finite
zero-point energy term and that makes us

343
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,740
有点快乐，但是我们实际上可以忽略它
a little bit happier but again we can
actually ignore it

344
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,630
删除它，因为它与温度无关，是温度
drop this because it's temperature
independent it's a temperature

345
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,200
独立的零点能量，我们还是要区分事物
independent zero-point energy we're
going to differentiate the thing anyway

346
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,659
所以我们真的不在乎它只是为了给我们一些整体
so we don't really care about it it's
just going to give us some overall

347
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,500
不断变化的能量不是很有趣，所以我们要
constant shift and the energy which
isn't very interesting so we're gonna

348
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,120
放下它，然后这个表达应该给我们能量
drop that anyway ok and then this
expression should give us the energy in

349
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,059
盒子或盒子中的热容量
the box or the heat capacity in the box
once we differentiate it at any

350
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:51,929
我们只是通过在此处插入温度来选择温度，但这很有用
temperature we choose just by plugging
the temperature in here but it's useful

351
00:29:51,929 --> 00:29:57,600
查看各种限制，因此第一个限制是低温限制， 
to look at various limits so the first
limit is low temperature limit and by

352
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:05,100
我的意思是说KBT比H-bar Omega Debye少得多，在这个限制下，我们得到了
that I mean KBT much less than h-bar
omega Debye and in this limit we get the

353
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,080
与之前的结果相同
same result
same result as we had before this result

354
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,419
正是在这里，这什么都没有改变，为什么那是原因，什么都没有
here exactly this nothing changes
why is that well the reason nothing

355
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:20,820
变化是因为在低温下，玻色系数很快消失
changes is because at low temperature
this Bose factor vanishes very quickly

356
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,500
在您接近Debye频率时的频率Bose系数
with frequency by the time you're up
near the Debye frequency the Bose factor

357
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,679
基本上是零，所以在Debye切断它并不重要
is essentially zero anyway so it doesn't
matter if you cut it off at the Debye

358
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,980
频率或分频的两倍或分频的一半
frequency or twice the divide frequency
or half the divided frequency the

359
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:36,030
那时那个时候被积数是零，所以你不必担心
integrand is zero anyway by that time so
you just you don't have to worry about

360
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,659
截止温度在低温下根本没有任何作用，因此您仍然
the cutoff at all at low temperature the
cutoff isn't doing anything so you still

361
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:45,360
得到我们想要的T立方热容，但是在高温下
get the T cubed heat capacity which is
what we want but at high temperature at

362
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,830
高温，我们会有一些不同的感觉，好吧，让我们看一下
high temperature we have something
different well okay so let's look at the

363
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,740
高温下的玻色系数beta H bar欧米茄很小
Bose factor at high temperature at high
temperature beta H bar Omega is a small

364
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,630
我们可以扩展指数，所以我们得到
number
we can expand the exponential so we get

365
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:06,130
 1加beta H吧Omega加婴儿床减去1，所以取消的那些使我们比beta H高1 
1 plus beta H bar Omega plus cot minus 1
so the ones cancel we get 1 over beta H

366
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:14,679
 bar Omega或我们得到Bo的因数被替换，Bo的KB超过H bar 
bar Omega or we get the Bo's factor is
replaced and Bo's becomes KBT over H bar

367
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:20,559
欧米茄，所以如果我们考虑这个Bo因子并将其插入该能量中
Omega so if we then take this Bo's
factor and plug it into that energy

368
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,530
表达式再次降低零点能量现在能量为整数零
expression again dropping the zero point
energy the energy is now integral zero

369
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:33,010
对不起，我要截止到截止日D Omega G Omega然后我们有H 
to sorry to I'll make it to by up to the
cutoff D Omega G Omega then we have H

370
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:38,409
 bar Omega，然后我们得到的Bose系数是H bar Omega的KBT 
bar Omega and then we have the bose
factor which is KBT over H bar Omega the

371
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:44,159
 H bar欧米茄（Omega）被取消，我们通过拉出KBT获得能量
H bar Omega is cancel and we get the
energy being given by pull out the KBT

372
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:52,630
 D Omega G Omega对Omega D的积分是0，这里的积分是
and integral 0 to Omega D by D Omega G
Omega and this integral here has been

373
00:31:52,630 --> 00:32:01,240
设计为正好为3 n，所以我们得到的能量为3，KBT 
designed to give us exactly 3 n so we
get the energy in the box is 3 and KBT

374
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:10,960
或热容量为3 km KB 
or the heat capacity is 3 km KB the law
of do long petite so by implementing

375
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,179
这个截止德拜设法获得负载温度热容为T 
this cutoff Debye managed to get the
loads temperatures heat capacity is T

376
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,890
立方高温热容仍是做长娇小法则
cubed the high temperature heat capacity
is still the law of do long petite so

377
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:28,570
很好，让我们看一些实际数据，这就是热量
that's pretty good let's look at some
actual data so this is the heat capacity

378
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,530
在很宽的温度范围内以及高温下的银
of silver over a broad range of
temperature and up at high temperature

379
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,960
您会发现这符合长时间做娇小且低温的定律
you see it's it's converging to the law
of do long petite and at low temperature

380
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,720
它大约是T立方体，德拜理论与实验相符
it's roughly T cubed and the Debye
Theory agrees with the experiment

381
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,500
非常非常好，您可以在同一地块的同一幅画上看到
extremely extremely well you can see on
the same on the same plot there's the

382
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,190
爱因斯坦理论非常适合，但不如
Einstein theory which fits pretty good
but not quite as well as to by

383
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,450
特别是在低温下，但在其他方面确实很重要
particularly at low temperature and but
on additional really important

384
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,580
从爱因斯坦到迪拜的改进是，德拜没有免费参数
improvement from Einstein to Dubai is
that Debye has no free parameters then

385
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,510
在德拜理论中，一切都是通过声速来固定的
everything is fixed in the Debye theory
by just the velocity of sound in the

386
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,200
密度，所以不知道你不能乱扔东西，你不能调整它
density so there's no knowing you can't
muck around you can't adjust things it

387
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,670
只是适合自己，所以这是一个真正的结果，似乎非常同意
just fits by itself so it's a really
result and seems to agree extremely well

388
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:18,970
通过实验，但我们仍然遇到问题，仍然是错误的或仍然可以
with the experiment but we still have
problems still wrong or still well okay

389
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:26,470
仍然错误的一件事是截断实际上是临时的临时特别是我们
things that are still wrong one is the
cutoff is really ad hoc cutoff ad hoc we

390
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,480
只是弥补了这一点，我的意思是这是有动机的， 
just sort of made this up I mean it was
a motivated it was a motivated thing to

391
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,630
这是一件很明智的事情，但我们没有做到这一点
do it was an intelligent thing to do but
we didn't it wasn't really justified

392
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:42,880
另一件事是错误的是我们使用与波成比例的Omega 
another thing that's kind of wrong is
that we used Omega proportional to wave

393
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:48,550
向量声音定律这里的频率将与波向量成比例，但是
vector the sound law here the frequency
will be proportional to wave vector but

394
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,890
我们在高K下使用它，这不是真的
we use this at high K and that's not
true

395
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,470
声音很小K到很小的时候就会出现长波长现象
sound is a small K a long wavelength
phenomenon when you go to very small

396
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,090
波长或非常高的波矢，这不再是真的，所以这很合理
wavelengths or very high wave vector
this is no longer true so this was sort

397
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,630
一个问题，我们在地毯下刷了什么，顺便说一句
of a problem that we brushed under the
rug and what and incidentally the the

398
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:11,168
当您在Debye频率附近起床时，我们正在谈论的波长
wavelengths we're talking about when you
get up near the Debye frequency the

399
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:14,139
波长接近原子间的间距，所以我们在谈论
wavelengths are close to the inter
atomic spacing so we're talking about

400
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,739
非常小的波长或非常高的波矢，我们不能
really really small wavelengths or
really high wave vectors and we can't

401
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:22,209
真的再考虑那种情况下的声音，所以这是一个问题

402
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:28,480
在地毯下刷另一件事是，德拜是不正确的，这是不正确的
brushed under the rug another thing is
that Debye is not exact it's not exact

403
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,460
对于任何材料，虽然从该图可以明显看出它非常好， 
for any material although it's pretty
good as is obvious from that plot and

404
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:41,649
第三或第四种金属是不同的金属对于我们的金属也是不同的
third or fourth metals are different
metals are different well for metals we

405
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:52,050
正如我上次提到的，金属具有低温比热C 
have for metals as I mentioned last time
we have low temperature specific heat C

406
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:59,890
正比于立方的alpha t加gamma T，其中debye预测了alpha，因此
proportional to alpha t cubed plus gamma
T where alpha is predicted by Debye so

407
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:03,670
如果您进行了德拜理论，则系数α正确，但是
if you did the Debye Theory you would
get the coefficient alpha correct but

408
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:07,120
您根本不会得到伽马，所以这只是一个大问题，我们现在不
you wouldn't get gamma at all so this is
just a big question right now we don't

409
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,400
知道那是哪里来的，所以我们必须弄清楚
know where that's where that's coming
from so we have to figure that out and

410
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,810
在几节课中，我们将很好地知道这是从哪里来的，但是对于
in a few lectures time we'll have a good
idea where that's coming from but for

411
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:21,220
现在，这可能是个谜，您现在可以对我说，但请稍候
now it's it's a bit of a mystery now you
might say to me at this point but wait a

412
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,990
第二不是银不应该是金属
second isn't silver a metal shouldn't I
see

413
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,400
低温下的线性热容确实银是金属， 
a linear heat capacity at low
temperature indeed silver is a metal and

414
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,180
您应该会在低温下看到线性热容量，但必须注意
you should see a linear heat capacity at
low temperature but you have to look at

415
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,520
很难看到它，所以它被炸得非常低
it pretty hard to see it so this is
blown up the very very low temperature

416
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,600
一二四或五开尔文或类似一二的政权
regime sort of one two four or five
Kelvin or something like that one two

417
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,110
你知道凯尔文（Kelvin）我猜，这里绘制的是热容
you know for Kelvin I guess and what's
plotted here is the heat capacity

418
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:49,400
除以温度作为温度平方的函数，如果是
divided by the temperature as a function
of temperature squared if it was a

419
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:54,619
纯净立方定律，那么这条线将是一条直线并且将相交
purity cube law then this line would be
a straight line and it would intersect

420
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:59,810
零它显然不相交零它与有限截距相交
zero it obviously doesn't intersect zero
it intersects a finite intercept which

421
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:04,610
实际上是伽玛，所以有一个非常小的术语伽玛这个术语是
is in fact gamma so there's a very very
small term gamma this term gamma is

422
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:08,330
很小，但显然必须仔细测量才能看到
pretty small but it's clearly there you
have to measure pretty carefully to see

423
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:16,070
它，但是没关系，所以在这一点上，我们已经说完了
it but it's there okay all right so at
this point we're sort of done talking

424
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:19,190
关于固体的振动一会儿，我们稍后再回来讨论
about vibrations in solids for a little
while we'll come back to them later in

425
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,250
当我们尝试更好地理解这些术语时
the term when we do a little bit of a
better job trying to understand these

426
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,320
事情，但是现在我们把它放在一边，我们将要换档
things but for now we've putting this
aside and we're going to switch gears

427
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,490
然后开始谈论金属，因为金属在以下方面明显不同
and start talking about metals because
metals are obviously different in

428
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:34,640
这是一种与众不同但又与众不同的方式
several ways this is one way that
they're different but they're different

429
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,480
还有很多其他方式，这就是众所周知的
in many other ways as well and this is
something that was this was known to

430
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,710
古代人都知道，甚至您可能在穴居人时代就知道了
known to the ancients even you know
probably in caveman days they they knew

431
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,930
他们发现在地面上发现的一些材料
that there were some materials they
found on the ground that just looked

432
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,680
与其他材料不同，到公元前4000年， 
different from other materials and by
4000 BC people were able to work with

433
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,369
某些金属之类的东西，例如铜，然后几千年后
certain metals things like like copper
and then a couple thousand years later

434
00:36:52,369 --> 00:36:55,400
他们能够使用铁，每次能够指挥
they were able to work with iron and
each time they were able to command a

435
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,910
特殊的金属并与之合作，他们能够使新事物做新
particular metal and work with it they
were able to make new things do new

436
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,680
使用新技术并真正改变人类的历史，因此您
devices new technologies and really
change the history of humankind so you

437
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,630
知道从金属犁开始金属剑金属盔甲金属战
know starting with metal plows metal
swords metal armor metal warfare of all

438
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:13,520
然后在金属机器上进行排序，您就会拥有金属摩天大楼， 
sorts then later on metal machines you
have metal skyscrapers you know the

439
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,050
核时代是由重金属和重金属音乐带来的
nuclear age was brought in by you know
heavy metals and heavy metal music very

440
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,740
也很重要，但您知道金属的历史
important also
but metals you know the history of

441
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,859
金属以某种方式追溯了人类的历史，您知道直到
metals in some way traces the history of
mankind and you know it wasn't until

442
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,300
确实在1800年代后期，有人最遥远的主意是什么导致金属
really the late 1800s that anyone had
the remotest idea what causes metals to

443
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,490
与众不同，在2000年代之前，我们才真正了解
be different and really in 2000's before
we really understood the properties of

444
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,710
重要的是，您必须记住您对我们了解
matter
you have to remember you know for us the

445
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:43,250
金属的定义属性将是导电
the defining property of a metal is
going to be that it conducts electricity

446
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,440
非金属则不知道，但我们什至不知道什么是电
and nonmetals don't but we didn't even
know what what electricity was until the

447
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,570
 1800年代末，JJ汤普森（JJ Thompson）发现电子或
late 1800s it was 1897 before JJ
Thompson discovered the electron or what

448
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,980
他称那小小的电荷小球可以在
he called the small corpuscle of charge
that can move around freely in the

449
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:03,500
金属，并可能通过足够高的电压从金属中弹出，并且
metals and could be ejected out of the
metal by a sufficiently high voltage and

450
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,940
这张金属的照片实际上是所有这些的容器
with this picture of the metal really
being sort of a container for all these

451
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,260
电子在周围跑来跑去成为人们的自然选择
electrons running around there became a
natural thing for people to do which was

452
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:16,400
考虑将这些电子作为一种气体围绕着电子而流动
to consider these electrons running
around as a gas a gas of electrons and

453
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,690
这就是保罗·德鲁德（Paul drew de）做的，被称为德鲁德（Drude）一种金属金属理论
this is what Paul drew de did was known
as Drude a theory of metals of metals

454
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:27,440
 Arjuna的运输理论适用于金属，实际上特别是
well Arjuna theory of transport applies
to metals and it's actually particularly

455
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,670
很好，它起作用了，这引起了理论，这是一个非常粗糙的经典动力学理论
good it works this drew the theory it's
a very crude classical kinetic theory

456
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:41,780
电子的电子动力学原理与电子的电子动力学原理非常相似
kinetic theory of electrons of electrons
very much like the kinetic theory of

457
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:46,580
您去年在热物理课程中研究的气体有效
gases that you studied last year in your
thermal physics course it works

458
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,940
尽管它非常粗糙，但效果非常好
extremely well despite the fact that
it's very crude it works extremely well

459
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:53,900
在很多方面对半导体特别有利，所以我们将
for a lot of things particularly well
for semiconductors and so we're going to

460
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:00,260
首先使用这种美容理论攻击您知道金属中的电子传输
attack you know electron transport in in
metals using this beauty Theory first

461
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,740
然后我们会在以后进行改进，例如您去年的动力学理论
and then we'll improve on it later so as
with your last year's kinetic theory we

462
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,310
为了使动力学理论可行，有两个假设
have a couple of assumptions assume in
order to get kinetic theory going one

463
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:21,740
从头到尾都有一个散射时间tau应该看起来很熟悉
there's a scattering time scattering
time tau should look familiar from last

464
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:26,120
的年份，我们的意思是
year by which we mean that the
probability of scattering probability of

465
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:37,070
时间T或时间DT上的scat等于tau上的DT 
scat in time T or in time DT is equal to
DT over tau now this probably looks

466
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,270
从去年开始熟悉气体动力学理论以来，我们
familiar from last year when you did
kinetic theory of gases last year we

467
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,080
需要连接它们的气体，您甚至可以预测散射时间tau是多少
need to connect their gases you can even
predict what the scattering time tau is

468
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,500
根据原子的大小以及它们移动的速度以及类似的东西
based on the size of the atoms and how
fast they're moving and things like that

469
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,339
首先，由于几个原因，今年我们不会那么幸运
this year we're not going to be so lucky
for a couple reasons first of all it

470
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:56,339
不清楚电子的散射截面应该是多少
isn't clear what the scattering
cross-section of the electron should be

471
00:39:56,339 --> 00:39:59,339
因为电子通过远距离库仑与事物相互作用
because the electrons interact with
things via long-range Coulomb

472
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:02,190
互动，使他们可以从很远的地方分散开来
interaction so they could they could
scatter from things very far away

473
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:05,819
可能会导致很难弄清楚是什么的另一件事
potentially another thing that's going
to make it difficult to figure out what

474
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:09,450
 tau的意思是电子除了可以散布其他很多东西
tau is is that the electron can scatter
off of lots of other things besides just

475
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:13,109
它们可以从质子中散射出来的其他电子，也可以从杂质中散射出来
other electrons they can scatter off of
protons it can scatter off of impurities

476
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:17,609
它可以散布在金属中的任何东西，所以对我们来说
it can scatter off of anything in it
happens to be in the metal so for us

477
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:22,380
这个散射时间tau只是一个现象学参数， 
this scattering time tau is just gonna
be a phenomenological parameter the

478
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,509
我们要假设的第二件事是在散射之后
second thing we're going to assume is
after scattering after a scattering

479
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:35,309
分散后的事件，我们会将最终动量设置为零，因此您
event after scatter we will set the
final momentum equal to zero so you

480
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:38,789
想像一下，您知道某事沿其移动，然后散布
imagine something you know something
moving along it scatters and then its

481
00:40:38,789 --> 00:40:41,309
最终动量为零，现在不正确
final momentum is zero now that's not
right

482
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:44,940
通常，当某物散布时，其最终动量在某些情况下会随机消失
generally when something scatters its
final momentum goes off randomly in some

483
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,609
随机方向，但作为矢量的平均值
random direction but on average as a
vector the average of the vector after

484
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,029
散射几乎接近零，因为它可能会消失
the scattering is pretty close to zero
because it can go off in any possible

485
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:57,569
方向，这将足以使我们能够做出
direction and that's going to be good
enough for us to be able to make

486
00:40:57,569 --> 00:41:02,609
进展您去年可能没有的第三点是
progress the Third Point which you
probably didn't have last year is that

487
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:13,940
电子之间的散射之间的散射事件之间应看到E 
between scattering events between
scatters the electron should see sees E

488
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,890
和B场（如果它们恰好在那），所以如果您要施加电场
and B field if they happen to be there
so if you're applying an electric field

489
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,009
电子会由于电场而加速到您的金属或
to your metal the electron will
accelerate due to the electric field or

490
00:41:23,009 --> 00:41:26,700
它会由于似乎很自然的磁场而弯曲，就像
it will curve due to the magnetic field
which seems rather natural just like the

491
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:33,059
电子，我们生活在真空中，所以考虑到这三个假设，我们可以
electron we're living in a vacuum okay
so given these three assumptions we can

492
00:41:33,059 --> 00:41:38,549
想象我们从在时间T具有动量P的电子开始，所以T为P 
imagine that we start with an electron
that has momentum P at time T so P of T

493
00:41:38,549 --> 00:41:46,890
动量很好，在时间T时间T很明显，然后我们想
is momentum well okay that's obvious at
time T time T and then we'd like to

494
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:53,190
计算在时间T和DT时的动量是什么意思
calculate what is the momentum at time T
plus DT I mean in some ways we're asking

495
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:57,779
在T加上DT时对动量的期望是什么，但我们将其视为
what the expectation of the momentum at
time T plus DT but we'll treat it as the

496
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:03,509
在时间T和DT时的实际动量
actual momentum at time T plus DT well
there's two things that can happen in

497
00:42:03,509 --> 00:42:08,310
在时间T时间T加DT之间，可能约为负1 
between time T
time T plus DT with probably one minus

498
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:13,830
 DT超过tau的概率，这是不散射概率的概率
DT over tau this is the probability this
is probability of not scattering prob of

499
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:20,100
不分散如果不分散，就不分散，然后发生什么好
not scattering not scattering if it does
not scatter then what happens well then

500
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:26,040
它具有区域动量加上对其施加的力乘以DT和
it has a regional momentum plus whatever
force is applied to it times DT and

501
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:32,730
没关系，这就是说DP DT（如果不分散）是F 
that's just okay this is just saying
that DP DT if it doesn't scatter is F

502
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:40,770
牛顿定律很好，但除此之外， 
Newton's law good but in addition to
this there's also the probability a

503
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:45,870
 DT相对于T的分散概率，如果分散，我们给出
probability DT over T that it does
scatter and if it does scatter we give

504
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:52,440
动量为零，所以这是不分散它的可能性
it momentum zero okay so this is a
probability of not scattering it

505
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,850
由于施加在其上的力，其照常加速，如果它确实散开，我们
accelerates as usual due to the force
applied to it and if it does scatter we

506
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:00,990
散射好之后，将其动量设为零，那么我们可以做一点
give it momentum zero at after the
scattering okay then we can do a little

507
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:04,740
稍微重新排列一下，实际上也许我们先将其相乘
bit of rearrangement here well actually
maybe let's multiply this out first so

508
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:17,970
这是T的P加F DT减去tau上的P，然后是DT，然后
this is then P of T plus F DT minus P
over tau and then there's DT and then

509
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:23,490
有加号DT的平方，加上一些重新排列，我们可以写
there's plus order DT squared and with a
little bit of rearrangement we can write

510
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:38,010
 DP DT应该是T处的P + DT减去DT上的T的P，如果我对我大吼
DP DT which should be P at T plus DT
minus P of T over DT yell at me if I

511
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,730
开始难以理解的写作，你知道它是否真的太痛苦了
start writing incomprehensibly
you know if it really gets too painful

512
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:45,240
只是对那边的方程式进行了一些重排
and just doing a little bit of a
rearrangement on that equation up there

513
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:52,350
并将这个组合放在一起，我们得到F但在tau上减去P，所以让我
and putting together this combination we
get F but minus P over tau so let me

514
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:59,040
重写它，因为这是一个重要的方程DP DT等于力
rewrite this because this is an
important equation DP DT equals force

515
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:08,070
在tau上减去T，这就是juda传输方程，以及什么力
minus T over tau this is known as the
juda transport equation and what force

516
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,970
你应该很好地使用它的力量是通常的洛伦兹力量吗
are you supposed to use in it well the
force is the usual Lorentz force force

517
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:19,600
是负e e加V叉B，所以无论用什么力
is a minus e
e plus V cross B so whatever force the

518
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,760
电子感觉进入那个方程，所以看起来很像
electron feels goes into that that
equation so this looks a lot like

519
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,300
 DP DT中的牛顿方程等于F是牛顿方程，但我们有
Newton's equation in DP DT equals F is
Newton's equation but we have this

520
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,680
右边的附加术语，看起来像是阻力，是
additional term on the right hand side
which looks like a drag force it's a

521
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,850
与当前动量相反的力
force going in the opposite direction
from its current momentum so whichever

522
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,150
方向，力朝相反的方向拉，所以
direction it's going the force is
pulling in the opposite direction so

523
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:45,160
让我们实际上在这里做一个非常快速的计算让我们考虑一下
let's actually do a really quick
calculation here let's consider consider

524
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:52,930
在系统中没有电场或磁场的情况下， 
the case where there's no no electric or
magnetic fields in your system so you're

525
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:59,250
不施加任何电场或磁场，则DP DT为负
not applying any electric or magnetic
field then you just have DP DT is minus

526
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:06,760
 P over tau可以解决，方法是说T的P是一些花生
P over tau which you can solve by saying
P of T is some peanuts some initial

527
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:13,900
动量e减去tau的负T，所以告诉我们，如果我
momentum e to the minus T over tau so
that tells us that the momentum if I

528
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:17,980
有一个电子和一些初始动量一起运动，这个散射项
have an electron moving along with some
initial momentum this scattering term

529
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:25,210
在这里，它随着时间刻度tau呈指数下降到零动量，所以它是
here slows it down exponentially to zero
momentum with a time scale tau so it's

530
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:29,560
就像是阻力，所以理论上的直觉想法是您对待散射
like a drag so that the idea of the dru
to theory is that you treat scattering

531
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:33,520
作为拖延力量，试图减慢一切或阻碍一切
as a drag force that tries to slow
everything down or hinder it's it's

532
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,550
运动，我想我们会停在那儿，然后我们将撤回理论
motion and I guess we will stop there
and we'll pick up withdrew the theory

533
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:40,080
下次我明天见
next time I'll see you tomorrow

534
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:46,289
