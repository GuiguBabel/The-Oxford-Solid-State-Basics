1
00:00:00,619 --> 00:00:05,570
让我们开始吧，欢迎回到这是凝聚态的第十一讲
let's get going welcome back this is the
eleventh lecture of the condensed matter

2
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:10,600
我们上次学习互惠空间的课程
course where we left off last time we
were studying reciprocal space

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:19,010
互惠的空间，我们来到这种理解
reciprocal space and we came to this
understanding that the reciprocal

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:23,630
晶格是直接晶格的傅立叶变换，也是我们产生晶格的原因
lattice is somehow the Fourier transform
of the direct lattice and the reason we

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,820
想研究互惠空间是因为它将使我们的生活
want to study reciprocal space is
because it's going to make our life

6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,689
当我们学习波浪时比较容易，所以这是一件相当重要的事情
easier when we come to studying waves so
it's a rather important thing to to

7
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:33,800
很好理解，有时也很难理解傅立叶变换
understand well and sometimes it's hard
to understand Fourier transform as well

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,660
因为它们不是我们在日常生活中考虑的东西，而是
because they're not something that we
think about in everyday life it's a

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,559
有点复杂，所以事实证明，有一种更好的几何方法
little bit complicated so it turns out
that there's a much nicer geometric way

10
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,440
了解很多相互的空间，这是我们将要讨论的
to understand a lot of reciprocal space
which is what we're going to discuss

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,309
今天，我像往常一样需要一些定义，让我们从一个简单的开始
today so I need some definitions as
usual let's start with a simple

12
00:00:49,309 --> 00:01:06,490
定义一个晶格平面等于一个包含三个三个平面
definition a lattice plane equals a
plane containing containing three three

13
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:17,899
非共线非共线线性，因此线性，因此
non collinear non collinear linear and
therefore linear and therefore an

14
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:32,649
无限数量，因此晶格点无限
infinite number and therefore infinity
of lattice points

15
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,979
好吧，所以晶格平面是包含三个非共线和
okay so a lattice plane is a plane
containing three non collinear and

16
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,950
因此，无数个晶格点，所以这是一些
therefore an infinite number of lattice
points so here's some pictures of

17
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:45,000
晶格平面这里我们在左边，我们有一个BCC晶格，还有一个平面
lattice planes here we on the Left we
have a BCC lattice there's a plane

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,479
穿过三个点，因此如果您继续到无穷远，它将
cutting through three points therefore
if you continued out to infinity it will

19
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,229
切掉无穷多个点，它们是晶格平面上的
cut through an infinity number of points
that's the lattice plane there's on the

20
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,560
右边是这个简单的立方格子，有一个平面可以切成三个
right is this simple cubic lattice
there's a plane that cuts through three

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,790
晶格点，如果您继续到无穷大，它将切入无限
lattice points if you continue out to
infinity it cuts through an infinite

22
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,940
晶格点数另一个定义是晶格平面族
number of lattice points another
definition a family of lattice planes of

23
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:14,760
格子飞机妈妈格子飞机婴儿格子飞机现在我在开玩笑那不是
lattice planes mama lattice plane baby
lattice plane now I'm joking that's not

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:23,760
在这个班上没有人笑过的是家庭最后一架飞机等于
what uh no one ever laughs in this class
it is families last planes equals an

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:39,150
无限无限等距等距等距格
infinite infinite infinite and finite
set equally spaced equal spaced lattice

26
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:57,829
包括所有晶格点和所有平面点的平面
planes such that such that all lattice
points all flat points are included are

27
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:12,540
包括在一架飞机中的飞机让我知道我的写作是否开始
included in one of the planes in planes
let me know if my writing starts getting

28
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,150
太杂乱而无法阅读，所以这里有一个简单的立方晶格和几个
to be too messy to read so here's a
simple cubic lattice and a couple of

29
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,150
晶格平面族这些剪切的晶格平面中的每一个
families of lattice planes each one of
these the lattice planes that cut

30
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,329
通过无数个晶格点，它们之间的间距相等， 
through an infinite number of lattice
points and they're equally spaced and

31
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,100
当包含所有元素时，它们包括晶格中的每个点
they include every single point in the
lattice when taken all together this is

32
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,760
一个BCC晶格，并且BCC晶格切割有一系列晶格计划
a BCC lattice and there's a family of
lattice plans for the BCC lattice cuts

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,049
通过BCC晶格中的所有晶格点，但这不是一个族
through all the lattice points in the
BCC lattice this however is not a family

34
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:40,920
 BCC晶格的晶格平面，即使它们的晶格平面是什么
of lattice planes for the BCC lattice
even though their lattice planes what's

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,510
绘制它们等距，但它们不包括
drawn they are equally spaced but they
do not include

36
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:47,959
他们在常规比赛中错过了这些家伙的格子点
the lattice point they miss these guys
here in the middle of the conventional

37
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,510
因此，它不是晶格平面族，所以连接
unit cell therefore it is not a family
of lattice planes okay so the connection

38
00:03:53,510 --> 00:04:05,150
到相互的晶格平面晶格平面族
to the reciprocal lattice plane a family
of lattice planes family of lattice

39
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:21,699
平面垂直于倒数晶格矢量，我称之为G 
planes is perpendicular to a reciprocal
lattice vector back which I'll call G

40
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:29,260
进一步和距离间距
and further and the distance the spacing

41
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:47,169
相邻平面之间的距离D等于PI 
between between neighbor planes between
neighbor planes planes is D equals to PI

42
00:04:47,169 --> 00:05:04,039
超过绝对G min，其中恶魔等于的最短沉淀晶格矢量
over absolute G min where demon a demon
equals shortest precip lattice vector at

43
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:16,639
 lat BEC朝向G方向
lat
BEC in direction in direction of G okay

44
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,440
每当我们有一个晶格平面族时，这就是一个重要的陈述
this is an important statement every
time we have a family of lattice planes

45
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,690
与该晶格平面族正交，存在互易晶格
orthogonal to this family of lattice
planes there is a reciprocal lattice

46
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,620
向量，如果您想知道晶格平面之间的间距
vector and if you want to know the
spacing between the lattice planes in

47
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,979
晶格平面族，您会发现最短的倒易晶格矢量
the family of lattice planes you find
the shortest reciprocal lattice vector

48
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,820
在那个方向上指向PI超过那个最短的绝对值
pointing in that direction to PI over
the absolute value of that shortest

49
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,979
倒数晶格向量为您提供平面之间的间距
reciprocal lattice vector gives you the
spacing between planes okay this is a

50
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,300
我们尚未证明的重要声明，实际上证明这一声明很有用
big statement we haven't shown it it's
useful to actually prove this statement

51
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:48,800
因为实际上在证明中，我们有很多重要的几何
because actually in the proof there's a
lot of important geometry that we're

52
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,419
一会儿需要，所以让我们通过证明
going to need in coming up in a moment
so let's go through the proof that this

53
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:57,920
是真的，所以首先，这只是一个证明
is true so first of all so this is just
a proof

54
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,710
首先，您可能还记得一些几何图形
by geometry a little bit of geometry
that you probably remember first of all

55
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:10,900
它定义了我们的向量G G点的平面拾取点x等于常数C 
it's define a plane pick of our vector G
G dot points x equals a constant C

56
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:23,510
定义一个平面，该平面找到点X垂直的点的平面
defines a plane it finds a plane of
points of points points X perpendicular

57
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:33,140
垂直于G的G，好的，实际上我可以在此处绘制
to G perpendicular to G where okay let
me actually draw this over here so

58
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:40,160
这是零点这是向量G这是垂直于G的平面
here's the point zero here's the vector
G here's the plane perpendicular to G

59
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:48,680
当调用X时，这是点X的平面和距零的距离
which when calling X this is the plane
of points X and the distance from zero

60
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:57,410
到飞机X的距离叫X min ya，其中X min最小
to the plane X let's call that distance
X min ya where X min the minimum

61
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:04,070
到平面的距离等于C超过绝对G，好吗？ 
distance to the plane equals C over
absolute G okay does that geometry look

62
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:11,270
之前看起来很熟悉，看起来还不错，所以这里的X分钟是C 
familiar from before it does it look
reasonable yeah so the X min here is C

63
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:17,540
如果我们用GX定义平面等于C，那么绝对G就可以了
over absolute G if we're defining the
plane by GX equals equals C okay so

64
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,080
这就是您要如何定义一个平面现在我们要定义一组
that's how are you going to define a
plane now we're going to define a set of

65
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:33,200
我们由每个I GE x定义的平面的平面集合等于1，所以为什么
planes set of planes of planes we define
by each of the I GE x equals 1 so why

66
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,450
是否将平面集合定义为IG点x等于1的e相同
does that define the set of planes well
e to the I G dot x equals 1 is the same

67
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:48,740
说GX等于2 pi M，其中m是整数M，有一个元素
thing as saying GX equals 2 pi M where m
is an integer M there's an element of

68
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:56,180
正确的整数，所以这意味着我们有一堆最小的平面
integers right so so that means we have
a whole bunch of planes whose minimum

69
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:06,449
距原点的距离为2 pi M，因此X min等于绝对G上的2 pi M 
distance to the origin is given by 2 pi
M so X min equals 2 pi M over absolute G

70
00:08:06,449 --> 00:08:22,449
因此，这些平面之间的空间平面D之间的间距为2 PI 
so space in between these planes spacing
between planes planes D is 2 PI over

71
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,820
绝对G好吧，实际上我对它的了解比我能画的要好
absolute G okay let's actually I have a
better picture of that than I can draw

72
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:33,520
所以我们感兴趣的几何形状是e等于IG x等于1，它定义了一组
so the geometry we're interested in is e
to the IG x equals 1 it defines a set of

73
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,870
平行平面中的一个将是GX等于
parallel planes
one of the planes will be GX equals to

74
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,120
 PI M另一个平面将是x处的G等于PI M加第一个平面的距离1 
PI M another plane will be G at x equals
to PI M plus 1 the distance of the first

75
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,920
平面在绝对G上为2 pi M，第二个距离为第二pi 
plane is 2 pi M over absolute G the
second distance the second plane is 2 pi

76
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,750
并在绝对G上加1，因此两者之间的距离在G上为2 pi 
and plus 1 over absolute G so the
distance between the two is 2 pi over G

77
00:08:52,750 --> 00:09:01,060
几何看起来还不错吗，是的，好吧，所以现在回想一下，如果G 
is that geometry look pretty good yeah
ok good alright so now recall that if G

78
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:09,610
是倒数晶格向量，所以G是倒数向量，我们再往后
is a reciprocal lattice vector so G is
reciprocal vector we sip flat back then

79
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:24,730
对于所有间接格，对于所有的间接格，e到i gr等于1 
e to the i gr equals 1 for all for all
our indirect lattice and indirect that's

80
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:31,029
互易晶格的定义，这样告诉我们的是
a definition of the reciprocal lattice
so that what that tells us is that every

81
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:37,000
晶格点将包含在这组平面中，因为
lattice point is going to be included
inside this set of planes okay because

82
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,890
如果g是倒数晶格，则任何R都必须满足EBI g点r等于1 
any R will have to satisfy EBI g dot r
equals 1 if g is reciprocal lattice

83
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,040
向量，所以我们在直接晶格中的所有晶格点都将是
vector so all of our lattice points in
the direct lattice are going to be

84
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,690
包括在我们刚刚定义的这套飞机中，但这并不意味着
included in this set of planes that we
just defined however it does not mean

85
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,060
每个飞机都切过晶格点好吧，为什么不好，这是这里的
that every plane cuts through lattice
points okay why not okay here's a here's

86
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,120
图片说明，这里我们有一组由一些倒数定义的平面
a picture to explain that here we have a
set of planes defined by some reciprocal

87
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,570
我将恰好称为G min的晶格矢量，在这里我们有一组平面
lattice vector which I'll happen to call
G min and here we have a set of planes

88
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,910
由两倍的倒数晶格矢量定义
devided defined by twice that reciprocal
lattice vector the spacing between the

89
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,560
晶格平面大一半，因为在G上间距始终为2 pi 
lattice planes is half as big because
the spacing is always 2 pi over G you'll

90
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,579
请注意，在第二张图片中，我们有一个由此定义的平面
notice it in the second picture we have
a plane which is defined by this

91
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:21,790
不与任何晶格点相交的倒数晶格矢量G 
reciprocal lattice vector G which
doesn't intersect any lattice points

92
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,200
该法所保证的是，所有直接晶格点必须是
what were guaranteed by this law is that
all direct lattice points must be

93
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,820
包括在一架飞机中，但不能保证每个飞机都必须
included in one of the planes but were
not guaranteed that every plane has to

94
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:36,670
穿过晶格点好吧，所以如果我们想得到一组平面
cut through a lattice point okay so if
we want to get a set of planes in which

95
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:42,790
每个飞机上的每个人都穿过我们必须选择的晶格点
everyone every plane cuts through
lattice points we have to choose so to

96
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:53,680
得到晶格平面的晶格族，并成为晶格平面
get family of lattice planes of lattice
planes and to be a lattice plane it has

97
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,660
必须穿过一个晶格点，所以如果我们要设置一组平面
to has to cut through a lattice point so
if we want to set of planes where every

98
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:07,829
平面切过一个晶格点，我们必须选择必须选择最短的gmm 
plane cuts through a lattice point we
must choose must choose gmm the shortest

99
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:13,680
给定方向上的倒数晶格矢量（如果不是最小值） 
reciprocal lattice vector in that given
direction if it was not the minimum

100
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,550
在该方向上的倒数晶格矢量，您可以将其缩小
reciprocal lattice vector in that
direction you could make it smaller cut

101
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,350
例如，将其减半，得到的飞机平面更少，但所有
it in half for example and get something
which has fewer planes and yet all of

102
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,110
晶格点仍应包括在内，因此您应尽量减少
the lattice points should still be
included so you should take the minimum

103
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:29,769
倒数晶格矢量，以便获得足够的平面
reciprocal lattice vector so that you
get enough planes

104
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:32,800
确保您所有的晶格点都在直接晶格中
there's guaranteed that all all your
lattice points in the direct lattice

105
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,990
将被包括在那些飞机上，但是您没有得到任何额外的好处，好吧
will be included in those planes but you
don't get any extra okay good all right

106
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:45,070
这就是那个相当重要的定理的证明，现在是
so that's the the proof of that of that
rather important theorem now it's it's

107
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:50,320
实际提出一些描述这些相互关系的方法很有用
useful to actually come up with some
some way to describe these reciprocal

108
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,850
晶格平面是这些晶格平面族或这些倒数
lattice planes are these these family of
lattice planes or these reciprocal

109
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,870
格向量，这是一种符号，我们将非常使用
lattice vectors and this is a type of
notation that we will use very

110
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,180
通常被称为米勒指数
frequently known as Miller indices for

111
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:18,760
用于描述描述飞机系列的飞机
describing for describing describe
families of planes planes planes

112
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:32,470
或收件人米勒索引中可观空间向量中的向量是
or vectors in respectable space vectors
in recipient Miller index is that you

113
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:39,610
用圆括号HK L表示实际上也许我会先
write in parentheses HK L to mean
actually maybe maybe I'll before I do

114
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,690
好吧，我们描述了互易空间中平面或向量的族
that alright we describe families of
planes or vectors in reciprocal space in

115
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:56,529
 XB sub I的参考向量项的术语这些B sub I是
terms of terms of reference vectors
reference of X B sub I these B sub I is

116
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:00,579
非常重要的是它们可能是原始的原始倒易晶格矢量或
very important they may be primitive
primitive reciprocal lattice vectors or

117
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:05,649
他们可能通常不是我们要做的是我们写的是我开始写的
they may not be generally what we do is
we write was I starting to write a

118
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:15,430
括号中的第二行HK L表示H乘b1加K乘b2加L乘b3 
second go HK L in parentheses to mean H
times b1 plus K times b2 plus L times b3

119
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:22,720
这个符号看起来有点熟悉，我们可以将其与
and this notation should look a little
bit familiar we can compare it to the

120
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,980
我们在现实空间中使用的符号间接空间直接空间中我们使用的符号u 
notation we use in real space indirect
space direct space we use the notation u

121
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:45,579
 v W表示u乘以1加V乘以2加W乘以3，所以重要的是
v W to mean u times a 1 plus V times a 2
plus W times a 3 so the important thing

122
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:49,750
要带走的是，如果我们在此处使用弯曲的括号，则表示
to take away here is that if we use
curved parentheses here we mean

123
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:54,040
倒数空间，如果我们使用方括号，是指直接空间，所以不要
reciprocal space if we use square
brackets we mean direct space so don't

124
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,410
现在在这两种情况下将它们彼此混淆，我们可能或可能不是故意的
confuse those with each other now in
both cases we may or may not mean these

125
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,959
这些B的帮助是原始的，这很重要，因为很多
aids of these B's to be primitive okay
that's very important because a lot of

126
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,860
考试中出现的问题恰好参考了这种细微之处
the questions that come up on exams
exactly reference this subtlety that

127
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,279
有时您使用原始晶格事实倒数晶格矢量
sometimes you work with primitive
lattice fact reciprocal lattice vectors

128
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,910
或原始晶格向量，有时您不为什么不使用
or primitive lattice vectors and
sometimes you don't why don't use

129
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,449
有时是因为有时原始格向量或原始
sometimes because sometimes the
primitive lattice vectors or primitive

130
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:22,899
倒数晶格向量是丑角，如果您选择使用
reciprocal lattice vectors are ugly
angles and if you choose to use a

131
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,380
可以使用常规单位单元而不是原始单位单元
conventional unit cell rather than
primitive unit cell you can use

132
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,760
正交向量而不是使用怪异角度的东西，所以如果可以的话
orthogonal vectors rather than using
things that weird angles so if you can

133
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,430
使用正交通常可以做到，即使这意味着您没有使用
use orthogonal you usually
do even if it means you're not using

134
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:39,760
原始晶格矢量还可以，所以在这里要小心
primitive lattice vectors okay
so let's be be careful here being

135
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,850
小心小心我们的定义，规则就像
careful being careful about our
definitions the rules kind of go like

136
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:53,620
首先选择直接实空间返回直接空间矢量
this first choose direct real space back
there's direct space vectors direct

137
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:02,079
空间向量是一个子I，可能是这些东西，也可能不是
space vectors a sub I that's going to be
these things which may or may not be

138
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:11,829
我什至会写成原始的，可能不是PL v z-- p LVS 
primitive I'll even write that down may
or may not may not be PL v z-- p LVS now

139
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,490
对我们来说，您会记得我们有一条规则，那就是我们不会负责任
for us you'll remember we had this rule
that we're not going to be responsible

140
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:20,820
对于三维的晶格，其中轴不是正交的
for lattices in three dimensions where
the axes are not orthogonal okay for us

141
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:38,010
对于我们在3D中，我们总是选择选择正交正交A 
for us in 3d we always choose choose
orthogonal orthogonal A's okay

142
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,860
有时在2D中，他们会问一个问题：它们不是正交的，但在3D中
sometimes in 2d they'll ask a question
where they're not orthogonal but in 3d

143
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:47,279
我们总是选择选择正交A表示简单立方
we always choose choose orthogonal A's
that means for simple cubic simple cubic

144
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,640
三次，这些可以是原始格向量tlv，但对于FCC FCC和
cubic these can be these are primitive
lattice vectors tlvs but for FCC FCC and

145
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,970
 BCC不是PL v，但它们具有正交的优势
BCC these are not not PL v's but they
have the advantage of being orthogonal

146
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:04,449
因此，它们使您的生活变得更加轻松，因为使用起来更加轻松
so they make your life a lot easier
because it's a lot easier to work with

147
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:08,170
正交的东西比不正交的东西还好
things that are orthogonal than things
that are not orthogonal okay so given

148
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:14,910
我们已经定义了这些A，然后构造了B，因此可以这样称呼为
that we've defined these A's we then
construct B's so can so call that to

149
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:20,670
构造B的
construct construct B's

150
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:33,399
 bi bi AJ等于2 pi Delta IJ，我们在如果且仅当
bi bi AJ equals 2 pi Delta IJ and we've
seen this equation before if if and only

151
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:44,829
如果是我们的PL B，那么蜜蜂将是倒数，我们的倒数是这些
if is our pl B's then bees will be
reciprocal our reciprocal repeal these

152
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:49,830
如果lat P lbs原语，我们在Reese是典型的吗
are we
typical at Reese if lat P lbs primitive

153
00:16:49,830 --> 00:17:00,540
格点向量对我们来说再好一次，因为我们已经在3d中使用3d 
lattice vectors okay again for us for us
since we are already using in 3d in 3d

154
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,880
由于我们一直在3D中使用正交轴，因此总是
since we are always using orthogonal
axes in 3d it will always turn out to be

155
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,619
 BI的绝对值等于PI超过PI的绝对值的情况
the case that the absolute value of BI
equals to PI over the absolute value of

156
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:22,379
 AI因为x是正交轴正交好所以使生活很多

157
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:35,130
比较容易，所以一般来说，当我们写下G等于HK L时，我们的意思是
easier so generally when we write down G
equals HK L we mean where is it this

158
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:47,070
 HB 1 + K ma已经是我们的意思了HB 1 + KB 2 + LB 
thing over here HB 1 plus K ma already
again we mean H B 1 plus K B 2 plus L B

159
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:53,370
 3以这种方式构造的蜜蜂，但总是G定义了一组
3 where the bees have been constructed
in this way but always G defines a set

160
00:17:53,370 --> 00:18:06,870
平面定义了一组平面，一组平面通过e到达IG x 
of planes defines a set of planes a set
of planes planes via e to the IG x

161
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:14,100
等于1 e到I GE x等于1，所以您可以始终定义一组平面
equals 1 e to the I GE x equals 1 so you
can always define a set of planes from

162
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:21,120
通过e到IG x的任何向量G等于1，并且这些平面的间距
any vector G via e to the IG x equals 1
and the spacing of these planes spacing

163
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:34,560
是d HK l等于绝对G的2pi还是我假设是在正交轴上
is d HK l equals 2pi over absolute G or
I guess in assuming orthogonal axes

164
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:42,270
假设正交蜜蜂正交A的正交正交10蜜蜂正交
assume orthogonal bees orthogonal A's
orthogonals a 10 bees orthogonal

165
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,480
正交的
orthogonal

166
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:54,950
那么我们可以写成2 pi超过H平方的绝对值
then we have we can write that as 2 pi
over absolute value of H squared

167
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,020
绝对b1平方加K平方绝对b2平方加
absolute b1 squared
plus K squared absolute b2 squared plus

168
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:10,530
 l平方恰好是3平方，对于立方晶格，对于立方，对于立方
l squared happens to be 3 squared ok and
for cubic lattice for cubic for cubic

169
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,720
其中a 1 2和a 3的长度相同且彼此正交
where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the same
length and orthogonal to each other

170
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,310
因此B 1 B 2 B 3的长度相同且彼此正交
therefore B 1 B 2 B 3 are the same
length and are orthogonal to each other

171
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:29,340
间距D HKL是图元的长度，是常规长度
the spacing D HKL is a the length of the
primitive the length of the conventional

172
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:37,430
 H平方加K平方加l平方的间接空间中的晶胞
unit cell in indirect space over H
squared plus K squared plus l squared

173
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:47,810
好吧，也许我会再注意一次，如果A是PL而不是A是PL B 
okay and maybe I'll note this one more
time if the A's are PL vs A's are PL B's

174
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:55,500
然后蜜蜂是PL V，然后是B的PL V，将其写在B的PL V之上， 
then the bees are PL V's then B's PL V's
to write that above B's PL V's and that

175
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:06,300
表示H KL是倒数晶格向量，我们向后倾斜，但不是
means that H KL is a reciprocal lattice
vector we sip lat back but it's not

176
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,960
总是这样，如果A不是PL V的开头
always the case
if the A's are not PL V's to start with

177
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:19,080
好吧，假设某人递给您一套飞机，并要求您
ok all right so supposing someone hands
you a set of planes and asked you for

178
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,470
听起来很难找到米勒指数，但实际上
the Miller indices that sounds like it
might be hard to figure out but in fact

179
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,760
有一种简单的方法可以从几何上找出米勒指数
there's an easy way to figure out
geometrically what the Miller indices

180
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,710
是针对一组平面的，这称为拦截方法
are for a set of planes and this is
known as the method of intercept method

181
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:46,470
的截距有点像这样，所以假设我们有这样的
of intercepts goes kind of like kind of
like this so suppose we have so here's

182
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:53,720
三个轴x轴，y轴和z轴让我们假设是正交的，因此
three axes x-axis the y-axis and the
z-axis let's assume orthorhombic so the

183
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,590
基本晶格矢量和三个方向不一定相同
primitive lattice vectors and the three
directions aren't necessarily the same

184
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:05,220
所以称这为二和二为二，这将是我猜为1 2 A 1 3 a 1 
so call this a two and two a two and
this one will be I guess a 1 2 A 1 3 a 1

185
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:11,309
 4 a 1在这里，然后是三到三和三a 
4 a 1 here
then a three to a three and three a

186
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:14,340
三个假设我们要坐飞机
three
so suppose that we have a plane going

187
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,549
穿过原点，想象一下这里有一架飞机穿过原点
through the origin so imagine there's a
plane cutting through the origin here

188
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:24,960
然后像这样切开轴，所以您将前两个
and then also cuts through the axes like
this okay so you take the first two

189
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,679
其中一个平行平面切成与该平面平行的原点
parallel planes one of them cuts to the
origin it's parallel to this plane which

190
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,669
像这样切开轴，规则是HKL也许我会这样写
cuts through the axes like this the rule
is that HKL maybe I'll write it this way

191
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:45,200
 H是2 K是2 L，因为其比例与x截距上的1相同
H is 2 K is 2 L as a proportionality is
the same as a 1 over the x intercept is

192
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:55,850
 y截距上的2 a 2是Z截距上的2 a 3，所以在此图片中
2 a 2 over the y intercept is 2 a 3 over
the Z intercept so in this picture here

193
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:04,980
这将是1超过x截距是1超过4 a 2是超过y截距
this would be a 1 over the x intercept
is 1 over 4 a 2 is over the y intercept

194
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:12,269
是2上的1，Z截距上的3是3的1，所以它应该具有相同的
is 1 over 2 and a 3 over the Z intercept
is 1 over 3 so it should have the same

195
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:16,620
如果我们乘以最小公倍数和最小公倍数
ratios as this if we multiply by the
least common multiple least common

196
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:23,909
倍数，我们得到3逗号6逗号4作为Miller指数将是适当的
multiple we get 3 comma 6 comma 4 as
Miller indices that would be appropriate

197
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:30,480
对于这个平面，通常您将其写为3 6 4，而在不带任何逗号的情况下
for this this plane and generally you
write it as 3 6 4 without any commas at

198
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,620
至少只要不混淆应该放在哪里的逗号
least as long as there's no confusion as
to where you should put the commas if

199
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,429
如果您超过10，则必须指出逗号在哪里，否则不是
you go over 10 then you have to indicate
where the commas are otherwise it's not

200
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:46,049
清楚现在如果在这里和这以及我们在这里所说的3 6 4意味着什么
clear where it would be all right now if
and this and what we mean by 3 6 4 here

201
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:57,299
 3 6 4是3 B 1加上6 B 2加上4 B 3，这就是我们所说的
is that 3 6 4 is 3 B 1 plus 6 B 2 plus 4
B 3 and that's what we mean by the

202
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:01,919
米勒指数和那套米勒指数是倒数
Miller indices and that that set of
Miller indices is gives a reciprocal

203
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,399
与此平面垂直的晶格矢量在某些情况下
lattice vector which is normal to this
to this plane there's a some cases which

204
00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:13,940
如果一个平面不与访问相交，则要复杂一些
are a little more complicated if a plane
if a plane does not intersect an access

205
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:20,740
平面不相交访问不相交
plane does not not intersect an access
not intersect

206
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:34,150
与轴相交，则得到的密勒指数为零，得到密勒指数
intersect an axis then you get a miller
index of zero you get Miller index index

207
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:38,270
等于零，让我们看看是否可以解释那是什么
equals zero let's see if we can explain
what that is

208
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:46,190
所以这里又是三个轴，这是一个轴，这里可能是2 
so here again three axes this is the a
one axis out here maybe this will be a 2

209
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:54,740
这将是2 a 2，也许在这里我们有383，假设我们有一个轴
this will be 2 a 2 and maybe here we
have 383 and suppose we have an axis

210
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,490
轴总是切一个平面，总是切过0，然后再切下一个
axis always cut an a plane always
cutting through 0 and then the next

211
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:06,170
平面在这里切割，但它平行于x轴的a 1轴，因此从不
plane cuts here but it's parallel to the
a 1 axis here to the x axis so it never

212
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:11,960
拦截它，那么我们如何处理Miller指数呢？我们说H为2 K为2 
intercepts it so what do we do with the
Miller indices well we say H is 2 K is 2

213
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,080
 L也好，所以第一个问题是，如果
L as well okay so the first question is
where do we intercept the x-axis well if

214
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,980
它完全不拦截x轴，您可以说这真的像
it doesn't intercept the x-axis at all
you can say that it's really like

215
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:28,610
与x轴在无穷大处相交，因此我们在无穷大处写入1，然后在K 
intersecting the x-axis at infinity so
we write 1 over infinity here and then K

216
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:34,520
好吧，我们在2处的y轴与2相交，而在3处的z轴与相交
well we intersect the y-axis at 2 so 1
over 2 and we intersect the z-axis at 3

217
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,220
因此，我们将1覆盖3并乘以最小公倍数，得到1覆盖
so we write 1 over 3 and multiply by the
least common multiple and we get 1 over

218
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:50,240
无穷大0 3 3 2所以这里的米勒指数是0 3 2好的，让我展示
infinity 0 3 3 2 so the Miller indices
here would be 0 3 2 okay so let me show

219
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,150
您的几个示例这是一组1 0 0的Miller索引
you a couple examples of this here's a
set of Miller indices that are 1 0 0

220
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,910
因为它在1处与X相交，而与Z或Y不相交，所以这里是1 1 2 
because it intersects X at 1 and doesn't
intersect Z or Y here's one that's 1 1 2

221
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:09,350
因为它与1处的1 y处的X和1处的Z相交，所以1/2的倒数是2 
because it intersects X at 1 y at 1 and
Z at 1/2 the reciprocal of 1/2 is 2 so

222
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,510
是1 1 2所以你可以有一个情况
it's 1 1 2 so you can have a situation

223
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:22,510
可以具有小于0的米勒指数
can have can have Miller index less than
0 index

224
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:25,510
负
negative

225
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:36,750
像1-1 0，通常写成1 1，而在0处有一个横线
like 1-1 0 which you typically write as
1 1 with a bar over at 0 okay so the bar

226
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:46,750
条形表示否定表示否定，这只是常规的表示法
bar means negative means negative that's
just the notation that's conventionally

227
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:55,090
现在可以使用了，所以对于我们不协调的人来说，这是一个很大的道歉
used now ok so here is a great big
apology for the uncoordinated of our

228
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,160
社区，所以取决于您所说的方式来自海洋的哪一边
community so depending on what side of
the ocean you come from the way you say

229
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,550
如果您来自美国，那声音大不一样，您说1 1巴
this out loud is different if you're
from the United States you say 1 1 bar

230
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:12,550
如果您来自英国，则为0，您说1 bar 1 0我不知道为什么会这样
is 0 if you're from England you say 1
bar 1 0 I don't know why it makes things

231
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,750
令人难以置信的是，它写的时候完全不清楚
incredibly confusing when it's written
it's totally unambiguous the bar on top

232
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,760
表示负面，但当您大声说出来时，这完全令人困惑，没有人
means negative but when you say it out
loud it's totally confusing and no one

233
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,820
知道你的意思，所以我建议先写下来然后
knows what you what you mean so I
recommend just writing it down and then

234
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,510
每个人都知道你在说什么好吧，让我给你看一个例子， 
everyone knows what you're talking about
ok let me show you an example where we

235
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,200
米勒指数为负，所以这架飞机实际上可能并非如此
have a negative Miller index so this
plane here actually maybe it's not so

236
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,200
清楚，但应该是您应该能够
clear but but it's supposed to you
supposed to sort of be able to

237
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,830
用你的眼睛往下推，看到这架飞机有点像
extrapolate down with your with your
eyes and see that this plane is sort of

238
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,320
从此处开始然后向下移动，并且与z轴相交为负1/2，因此
starts up here and goes down and would
intersect the z-axis at minus 1/2 and so

239
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,840
它的截距是1 1减去1/2，所以它是Miller指数或1 1 2与
it's intercepts are 1 1 minus 1/2 so
it's Miller indices or 1 1 2 with the

240
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:57,730
否定为负2好的，所以这里有一堆不同的Miller指数
bar over it negative 2 ok so here's a
whole bunch of different Miller indices

241
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:03,910
对于一堆不同的飞机，他是0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1依此类推
for bunches of different planes he's 0 0
1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 so forth and so on

242
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,960
您会发现他们实际上实际上是某种家庭成员，所以如果
and you see that they actually they
actually kind of come in families so if

243
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,100
您会在第一行的第一行看到家庭，您会看到0 
you look at the family across the top
row across the top row you'll see the 0

244
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:16,000
 0 1和1 0 0它们看起来相似，而0 1 0看起来相似，如果
0 1 and 1 0 0 they kind of look similar
and 0 1 0 looks kind of similar and if

245
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,720
您以为实际上有一个样品，您知道这是一个简单的立方晶格， 
you imagined actually having a sample
you know it's a simple cubic lattice and

246
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,370
您拿起简单的立方晶格，然后从一侧对其进行了观察1 0 0 
you picked up the simple cubic lattice
and you looked at it from one side 1 0 0

247
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,630
看起来就像0 1 0，具体取决于您是否将其拿起并打开
would look exactly like 0 1 0 depending
on if you picked it up and turn it

248
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,410
侧面完全一样，只是取决于您拿起的那一侧， 
sideways it's exactly the same it just
depends on which side you picked up and

249
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:36,220
先看类似的1 0 1或1 1 0 
looked at first
similarly with 1 0 1 or 1 1 0 if you

250
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,370
拿起它，你侧眼看着它会
picked it up and you looked at it
sideways it would

251
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,300
飞机和那些家庭之间的距离完全一样
exactly the same okay the spacing
between planes and those families would

252
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,480
与通过设备斜切的方式完全相同
be exactly the same the way it cuts
diagonally through the through the unit

253
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,600
单元格看起来一样，只是选择哪种方式很重要
cell would look the same
it just matters which way you picked it

254
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,080
首先，所以我们有一个等效的符号
up in the first place
so we have a notation for equivalent

255
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:05,910
米勒指数集等同于我们的米勒指数集
sets of Miller indices equivalent sets
of Miller indices indices which we

256
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,309
请注意，我们有大括号，像那样可怕的大括号
notate we have curly brackets okay
that's terrible curly bracket like that

257
00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:24,510
 HKL表示等值集等效于HDL和常规括号
HKL which means equivalent sets equiv
sets of HDL and regular parentheses

258
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:33,240
方括号，例如，在此图片中，大括号1 0 0表示1 0 0或
brackets so for example in this picture
curly brackets 1 0 0 would mean 1 0 0 or

259
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:47,010
 0 1 0或0 0 1或1 bar 0 0或0 1 bar 0或0 0 1 bar巧合
0 1 0 or 0 0 1 or 1 bar 0 0 or 0 1 bar 0
or 0 0 1 bar on coincidentally you know

260
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,030
这些平面看起来像立方体的表面，您可以拾取
these planes look like the surface of a
cube and you can pick up the surface of

261
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,440
一个多维数据集，并以6种不同的方式查看它，从所有角度来看，它看起来都是等效的
a cube and look at it 6 different ways
and it would look equivalent from all

262
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:06,050
这六个不同的角度，我们也有称为HK L的多重性
those six different angles we also have
what's known as the multiplicity of HK L

263
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:18,570
该数字等于括号HK L中括号HK L的数量，因此
which is the number equals the number of
parentheses HK L in bracket HK L so in

264
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:28,740
在这种情况下，我们将具有1 0 0的多重性是6，因为它包括所有这些
this case we would have multiplicity of
1 0 0 is 6 because it includes all those

265
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:35,760
我写下了六组不同的米勒指数，所以对于第一个
six different sets of Miller indices
that I wrote down okay so for the first

266
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:44,309
一天的糖果吧1 2 3的多重性是多少
candy bar of the day what is the
multiplicity of 1 2 3 no

267
00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:53,110
现在是谁说某事48是的，这个谁说48 
now who is it someone said something
48 yeah yeah this who said that 48 this

268
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,510
一个人的你很好，我不能把它扔得那么远
one's yours very good I can't throw it
that far

269
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,280
 48答案是48，所以让我们看看为什么它的多重性是48 
48 the answer is 48 so let's see why the
multiplicity of this is 48

270
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:06,520
首先，两个和三个可以任意顺序排列，所以这是六个事实，或者是
first of all one two and three can be in
any order so that's six fact or that's

271
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:14,200
三个阶乘给您6 1 2 3 1 3 2 2 3 1 2 1 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 6可能的方式
three factorial gives you 6 1 2 3 1 3 2
2 3 1 2 1 3 3 1 2 3 2 1 6 possible ways

272
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,070
订购它们，但是除此之外，这些数字中的任何一个都可以有一个小节
of ordering them but then in addition
any one of those numbers can have a bar

273
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,460
是否在它上面所以这有2种可能性这有2种可能性
over it or not so this one has 2
possibilities this has 2 possibilities

274
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,330
她有2种可能性，有8种可能性，所以是8乘以6 
this she has 2 possibilities that makes
8 possibilities so it's 8 times 6 gives

275
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:31,780
你48好吧，所以1 2 3的多重性等于48，这很有趣
you 48 okay so multiplicity of 1 2 3
equals 48 which is kind of interesting

276
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,100
这意味着您是否拥有与1 2 3相关的晶格平面族
it means if you have the family of
lattice planes associated with the 1 2 3

277
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:41,200
您可以从米勒索引中选取一个简单的立方晶格，然后从48 
Miller indices you can pick up a simple
cubic lattice and look at it from 48

278
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,740
方向不同，且晶格面的间距完全相同
different directions and have lattice
planes with exactly the same spacings

279
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,929
看着你好吧，但那是真的
looking at you okay
sort of surprising but but that's true

280
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:54,790
好吧，为什么现在我们为什么如此关心这些晶格平面呢？ 
ok so now why is it we care so much
about these these lattice planes besides

281
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:58,090
他们会告诉我们很多关于互惠空间的事实，而我们
the fact that they're going to tell us a
lot about reciprocal space and we're

282
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,020
对波浪和波浪感兴趣，您知道互易空间是波浪的语言
interested in waves and waves you know
reciprocal space is a language of waves

283
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,910
这是我们可能对这些晶格家族感兴趣的原因之一
well the reason one reason we might be
interested in these families of lattice

284
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,600
互惠空间中的飞机是因为它们实际上告诉您很多有关
planes in reciprocal space is because
they actually tell you a lot about the

285
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,679
晶体的宏观结构，所有
macroscopic structure of the crystal
it's kind of interesting that all of

286
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,640
有关晶格平面和倒易晶格的信息，这就是全部
this information about lattice planes
and reciprocal lattices this was all

287
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,809
在人们甚至不知道有
worked out in the middle of the 1800s
before people even knew that there was

288
00:31:22,809 --> 00:31:26,440
诸如原子之类的东西及其解决方法是因为人们知道
such thing as atoms and the way it was
worked out is because people knew that

289
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,270
矿物质好晶体，而矿物质破裂，相反，它们仅沿
minerals nice crystal and minerals broke
instead they fractured only along

290
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,980
某些轴，这使他们能够推断出所有这些信息，因此对于
certain axes and that enabled them to
deduce all of this information so for

291
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,720
例如，您会发现一个简单的立方格子或任何类型的立方
example with a simple cubic lattice
you'll discover or any type of cubic

292
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,890
点阵将打破材料将沿着简单打破
lattice that the lattice will will break
the material will break along simple

293
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:52,059
简单的Miller索引集，例如此处的1 0 0面或0 1 0面
simple sets of Miller indices so like
the 1 0 0 face here or the 0 1 0 face

294
00:31:52,059 --> 00:31:57,250
这是材料最容易破裂的地方这是法律，不是
here is where the material will will
break most easily this is a law it's not

295
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,380
变硬了，但这是非常非常好的经验法则
a hardened
but it's a very very good rule of thumb

296
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,760
通过勇敢而著称的Brava是法律，是制定出所有晶格的那个人， 
by brav a known as Brava is law the same
guy who worked out all the lattices and

297
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,850
它实际上告诉您，当您拿起立方晶体而破裂时
it actually tells you that when you when
you take a cubic crystal and you break

298
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,440
它只会得到1 0 0张脸，偶尔也会得到1 1 0张脸
it you get only the 1 0 0 faces
occasionally you'll get the 1 1 0 faces

299
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:19,570
甚至偶尔你会得到1 1 2，所以这是钠的照片
and even less occasionally you'll get 1
1 2 so here's a picture of sodium

300
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,370
氯化物是立方晶体，实际上是FCC晶体，会破裂
chloride which is a cubic crystal it's
it's actually FCC crystal and it breaks

301
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,890
几乎只沿1 0 0晶格平面，您可以看到这些
almost exclusively along the 1 0 0
lattice planes you can see that these

302
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:35,740
这些断裂完全是在90度石英上的，好吧，我们不研究石英
these breaks are entirely at 90 degrees
quartz okay we don't study quartz this

303
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,820
今年，这只是一张非常不错的图片，所以我把它放在那里，我们不学习
year this is just a very nice picture so
I put it in there and we don't study

304
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:43,539
今年，因为轴不正交，这是一个三角形
that this year because the axes are not
orthogonal to each other it's a trigonal

305
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:48,429
水晶，但轴非常清晰，面孔非常清晰，非常固定
crystal but the axes very clearly the
faces are very clearly at very fixed

306
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:53,400
彼此的角度由晶格平面的排列方式决定
angles to each other which are dictated
by how the lattice planes are arranged

307
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:00,100
好吧，我将再强调一次这个事实，因为它显示了
okay so I'm going to emphasize this one
fact one more time because it shows up

308
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:09,370
如此频繁地参加考试，因此如果沙皇POV能够处理
on exams so frequently so this is
important fact if a czar POVs then deal

309
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,929
如果并且只有一个阶段或POV，那么B或PL B的情况我想我已经记下了
if and only a phase or POVs then B's or
PL B's I think I've written this down

310
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:19,120
今天是三倍，那么这些是五月的收件人
three times today
then these are P of a may recipients

311
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,909
收到Racal VL B，我们饮这些
receive Racal VL B's we sip peel these

312
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:37,799
例如，对于简单三次就是如此，这意味着任何HKL为h b1加k 
for example this is true for simple
cubic which means any HKL is h b1 plus k

313
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:45,190
 b2这是HK L b3的定义，所以这些都是幽灵的补充
b2 this is the definition of HK L b3 so
any of these is a resupply the specter

314
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:52,240
我们喝lat BEC是因为原始晶格向量的整数和给您
we sip lat BEC because integer sums of
primitive lattice vectors give you an

315
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,640
格的元素，如果我们想要一个晶格平面族
element of the lattice if we want a
family of lattice planes a family of

316
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:07,780
我们应该拥有的经纬平面的晶格面应该最短
lattice planes of lat planes we should
have should hat should be shortest be

317
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,379
最短的
shortest

318
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:26,210
在最短的给定方向上，我们在给定的方向上flat平Veck 
in a given direction shortest we sip
flat Veck in given direction so for

319
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:32,179
例如，如果我们考虑方向2 4 6是最短的倒数
example if we're considering the
direction 2 4 6 the shortest reciprocal

320
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:37,550
简单三次晶格中的最短倒易晶格矢量
lattice for the simple cubic lattice the
shortest reciprocal lattice vector in

321
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:50,330
那个方向是1 2 3所以u / /最大公约数所以如果你想
that direction is 1 2 3 so u / /
greatest common divisor so if you want

322
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:54,050
要描述一组晶格平面，您应该始终选择倒数
to describe a set of lattice planes you
should always choose the reciprocal

323
00:34:54,050 --> 00:35:04,220
在给定方向上最短的晶格矢量，但是如果
lattice vector which is shortest in that
given direction however however if the

324
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:14,089
那么A不是PL V的，然后是，然后蜜蜂不是PL V的不收信
A's are not PL V's then and this is and
then the bees are not PL V's not recipie

325
00:35:14,089 --> 00:35:26,810
 Alize意味着不是我们所有的补给向量都是接收格
Alize which means that not all HK L our
resupply us vectors are recipt lattice

326
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:40,630
向量，这是大多数最优秀的考试问题的根源，好吧，让我
vectors and this is the source of most
most good exam problems okay so let me

327
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:46,849
告诉你确切的意思，所以我们称这张图片和晶格
show you exactly what we mean by this so
we call this picture and the lattice

328
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:49,970
我在这张图片中绘制的最后一架飞机的家族是1架飞机
planes that the family of last planes
I've drawn in this picture here is the 1

329
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:55,070
 0 0族的晶格平面和G的最小倒数晶格矢量
0 0 family of lattice planes and and G
the minimum reciprocal lattice vector in

330
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,300
那个方向实际上是1 0 0这是简单的立方晶格，所以这是
that direction is in fact 1 0 0 this is
simple cubic lattice so this is

331
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,119
肯定是倒数晶格矢量中的晶格平面族现在有两次
definitely a family of lattice planes in
a reciprocal lattice vector now twice

332
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,950
到0 0是互易的晶格向量，但不是晶格族
that to 0 0 is a reciprocal lattice
vector but it's not a family of lattice

333
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:12,859
飞机，因为您有多余的飞机，您的飞机无法穿过
planes because you have extra planes you
have a plane that doesn't cut through

334
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:16,730
任何晶格都指向平面间距的一半，所以不是最后一个族
any lattice points half the spacing of
planes so it's not a family of last

335
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,700
平面，但是它是一个倒易的晶格矢量，现在让我们考虑一下
planes but it is a reciprocal lattice
vector now let's think about what

336
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,559
当我们转到带有BCC和FCC的BCC或FCC晶格时发生
happens when we go to either a BCC
or an FCC lattice with a BCC and FCC

337
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,839
格我们仍将使用相同的三个正交A 
lattice we're still going to use the
same three orthogonal A's we're going to

338
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,380
选择使用常规单位晶格来定义我们的A 
choose to use the conventional unit cell
to define our A's

339
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,249
就像我们对一个简单的立方晶格所做的一样，我们这样做并不是
just like we did with a simple cubic
lattice and we're doing this they're not

340
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:40,130
原始晶格因子，这是一个问题，但我们这样做是因为我们
primitive lattice factors and that's a
problem but we're doing it because we

341
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:42,950
想要保持一切正交，如果保持下去，生活会容易很多
want to keep everything orthogonal and
life is just a lot easier if you keep

342
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,380
一切都正交，所以这是一堆带有米勒指数的图片
everything orthogonal okay so here's a
picture with a bunch of Miller indices

343
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:51,470
还有一堆为简单立方晶格绘制的晶格平面，这里是1 0 
and a bunch of lattice planes drawn for
the simple cubic lattice here's the 1 0

344
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:56,210
如果您添加了BCC案例中我之前绘制的0组晶格平面
0 set of lattice planes just like I drew
before now in the BCC case if you added

345
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,499
该单元格中心的另一个点
one more point in the center of that
unit cell in the center of that

346
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:05,180
常规的晶胞，它不会与1 0 0平面集合相交
conventional unit cell it would not be
intersected by the 1 0 0 set of planes

347
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:11,599
它与平面2 0 0集相交，所以2 0 0是一个正确的族
it is intersected by the 2 0 0 set of
planes so 2 0 0 is a correct family of

348
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,920
 BCC的晶格面不是4 4简单立方确定是1 0 0甚至不是
lattice planes for BCC it is not 4 4
simple cubic ok is 1 0 0 isn't even a

349
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:22,849
 BCC的互易晶格矢量，因为它并不与每个相交
reciprocal lattice vector for BCC
because it does not intersect every

350
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:27,289
晶格点好，那就是微妙之处，我们将回到
lattice point ok that's that's the
subtlety and we're going to come back to

351
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:31,969
对于BCC，这种微妙的选择一遍又一遍，您必须选择Miller指数
this subtlety over and over for a BCC
you have to choose Miller indices to

352
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:35,450
确保您的每个晶格点都包含在其中之一
make sure that every one of your lattice
points is included in one of those

353
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:39,319
飞机的FCC相同，这是有问题的原因是因为我们正在使用
planes the same for FCC and the reason
this is a problem is because we're using

354
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:44,150
不是我们正在使用的原始晶格矢量的晶格矢量a 
lattice vectors a which are not the
primitive lattice vectors we're using

355
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,450
正交向量，因为正交使您的生活更容易相信或不相信
orthogonal vectors because orthogonal
makes your life easier believe it or not

356
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,890
如果我们考虑FCC晶格，并且考虑1 1 1，则与FCC相同
same with FCC if we consider the FCC
lattice and you consider the 1 1 1

357
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,660
这些平面在这里我们不会与这些晶格点相交
planes these planes here we would not
intersect some of these lattice points

358
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,809
这些将丢失，因此1 0 0不是FCC的倒数晶格矢量2 0 0 
these would be missing so 1 0 0 is not a
reciprocal lattice vector for FCC 2 0 0

359
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:13,400
同样可以，虽然我们可以在这里看1 1 1所以1 1 1是个很好的集合
is okay similarly while we can look at 1
1 1 here so 1 1 1 is perfectly good set

360
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,549
一个简单立方的晶格平面族就不会是
a family of lattice planes for simple
cubic it would not be a family of

361
00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:20,210
 BCC的晶格平面，因为它会错过单元中心的点
lattice planes for BCC because it would
miss the point in the center of unit

362
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,130
单元，但实际上它是FCC的晶格平面族，因为它只是
cell but actually it is a family of
lattice planes for FCC because it just

363
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:29,479
碰巧可以捕捉到脸部中央的所有这些点
happens to catch all those points in the
center of the faces okay now later on

364
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:33,019
我们实际上将得出一个条件，该条件将告诉我们何时
we're actually going to derive a
condition which will tell us when we

365
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,890
有米勒指数，我们的家庭
have
Miller indices which our family of

366
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,370
特定晶格的晶格平面，但重要的是要了解并非每个晶格
lattice planes for a particular lattice
but it's important to realize not every

367
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:45,250
并非每套米勒指数的集合都会给你倒数的格子
set of not every set of Miller indices
will give you a reciprocal lattice

368
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:49,720
 BCC和FCC晶格的向量或晶格平面族以及
vector or a family of lattice planes for
BCC and FCC lattice and the origin of

369
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:53,050
这个问题是我们没有使用原始格向量来描述
this problem is we're not using
primitive lattice vectors to describe

370
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,370
我们自己常规的我们正在使用常规单元电池的边缘
our conventional yourself we're using
the edges of the conventional unit cell

371
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,290
好的，很明显，我已经警告过您足够多的好事了吗
okay is that clear
have I warned you enough all right good

372
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:09,880
好的，这就是我们要说的关于互惠空间的一切，现在我们
all right so that's everything we have
to say about reciprocal space and now we

373
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,050
可以进入互惠空间的某些应用，也许是最
can get on to some applications of
reciprocal space and perhaps the most

374
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:19,740
我们将要遇到的重要应用是散射实验
important application we're going to run
into is scattering experiments

375
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:25,120
散射实验，这将是本讲座其余部分的主题， 
scattering experiments which will be the
subject of the rest of this lecture and

376
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:29,440
接下来的两堂课可能会讲很多，所以一般的散射实验
probably much of the next two lectures
so the general scattering experiment

377
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:38,410
从样本样本开始，您发送的是一些波向量为K的波
starts with a sample sample you send in
some wave with wave vector K some of it

378
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:43,510
经过无疤的波矢量k出现，其中一些出现在
goes through unscared comes out at wave
vector k and some of it comes out at

379
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,240
通过观察波向量k素产生的波向量k素
wave vector k prime by observing what
comes out at wave vector k prime you're

380
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,120
应该能够推断出样品中的成分现在很难高估
supposed to be able to deduce what is in
the sample now it's hard to overstate

381
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,360
您可能已经研究过这类实验的重要性
the importance of this type of
experiment you may have studied it in

382
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,530
其他课程，尤其是亚原子课程，但不是结束，不是
other courses especially subatomic but
it is not an over is not an

383
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,440
夸张地说，我们几乎所有关于微观的知识
overstatement to say that almost
everything we know about the microscopic

384
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,890
世界的一切，我们知道存在核的事实，我们
world everything the fact that we know
that there are nuclei the fact that we

385
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,280
知道原子的结构我们知道材料的结构
know the structure of atoms the fact
that we know the structure of materials

386
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,580
我们知道质子的结构这些事实都来自
the fact that we know the structure of
the proton all of these things come from

387
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,910
这类实验这种散射实验你知道我们成长了
this kind of experiment this type of
scattering experiment you know we grew

388
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,510
在一个甚至孩子都知道原子长什么样的世界里
up in a world where even kids know what
what atoms look like and they know what

389
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,570
 DNA看起来像这个双链螺旋，他们知道水分子是什么
DNA looks like this double stranded
helix they know what water molecule

390
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:28,390
看起来他们甚至可能知道盐分选成什么氯钠
looks like they may even know what salt
looks like sodium chlorine is sorted

391
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:32,110
在我们知道并且理所当然的所有这些东西都来自做之前
before all of this stuff that we know
and we take for granted comes from doing

392
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,800
这种实验唯一的不同之处就是
this kind of experiment the only thing
that's different when we do this

393
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,730
实验与什么时候高能物理学家做这个实验是什么
experiment versus when the high energy
physicist doing this experiment is what

394
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,410
首先我们开始讨论，现在我们有兴趣看到原子
wave we put in to start with okay now
we're interested in seeing atoms and

395
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,380
原子的大小约为埃
atoms are on the scale of about an
angstrom at

396
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:50,289
事实证明，选择波长为
turns out to be a really good idea to
choose a way of whose wavelength is

397
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:54,910
您想要看到的东西的规模差不多，所以对我们来说，他们将成为
about the same scale of the thing you
want to see so for us they're gonna be a

398
00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:00,490
几种选择之一是X射线电磁波，其长度尺度
couple of options one is x-rays
electromagnetic waves whose length scale

399
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:04,599
大约是一埃，这将使我们能够看到大小约为
is about an angstrom so that will enable
us to see things roughly of the size of

400
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:10,180
埃，但你知道我们生活在这个量子力学世界中，我们知道
an angstrom but you know we live in this
quantum mechanical world and we know

401
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,380
那波和粒子是同一件事，所以我们不仅有权使用
that waves and particles are the same
thing so we're entitled to use not only

402
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,200
我们通常认为是方式的事物，但我们通常认为是粒子的事物
things we usually think of as ways but
things we usually think of as particles

403
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,750
所以一个粒子很方便地进行散射实验
so a particle which is very convenient
to do scattering experiments with

404
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,609
你知道中子我认为中子是粒子，但是它们也在挥动
neutrons neutrons you know I think of as
in particles but they're also waves it

405
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:31,359
事实证明，获得中子的波长非常容易
turns out to be fairly easy to get
neutrons to have wavelengths which are

406
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,400
大约等于埃
on about the same scale of about an
angstrom

407
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,269
这样就很容易看到大约一埃的东西
which makes it easy to see things which
are on the scale of roughly an angstrom

408
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:40,690
这些几乎是我们要负责的两种类型的波浪
these are pretty much the two types of
waves that we're going to be responsible

409
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:44,559
今年，我应该提到人们经常使用电子波作为
for this year I should mention that
people frequently use electron waves as

410
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:49,990
好吧，但我们今年不研究它们，因为它们有一些并发症
well but we don't study them this year
because they have some complications

411
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:57,279
您不想钻研，所以无论我们发送到我们的任何类型的电波
which you don't want to delve into so
whatever type of wave we send into our

412
00:41:57,279 --> 00:42:02,559
物质我们应该想象的是样品中的原子
material the thing that we're supposed
to imagine is that the atoms in sample

413
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:18,099
样品中的原子提供的电位V为R，它会散射它
atoms in the sample provide a potential
a potential V of R it scatters it

414
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:28,359
散射波散射波，我们的目标实际上是
scatters wave scatters the wave and our
objective is actually a bit of an

415
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,640
反问题，而不是试图计算潜在的潜力
inverse problem where instead of trying
to calculate what does the the potential

416
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:38,799
由于波浪的发生频率更高，我们被告知波浪已经完成了什么
due to the wave much more frequently
we're told what the wave has done we've

417
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:43,299
测量了波浪的作用，我们正在尝试推断出潜在的
measured what the wave has done and
we're trying to deduce the potential the

418
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,900
势将告诉我们原子在材料中的位置，而我们
potential is going to tell us where the
atoms are in the material and we're

419
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:50,920
试图通过观察我们样本中的物质得出结论
trying to deduce that from observing
what physically came out of our sample

420
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,049
现在只是一个警告，很容易想到潜在的
now just a little bit of a caveat it's
easy to think about a potential for

421
00:42:56,049 --> 00:42:59,019
中子和中子在它周围移动时感觉有些潜能
neutrons and neutrons moves around it
feels some potential as it moves around

422
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:02,600
现在考虑潜在的机会要少一些
it's a little bit less now
to think about a potential for for

423
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,350
 X射线是电磁波，如果需要，您可以
x-rays which are electromagnetic waves
you can if you want you can kind of

424
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,970
认为它有光子的潜力，但如果您真的
think of it as a potential for photons
but much more appropriate if you really

425
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,710
应该将其视为空间相关的光学指数或空间上的
should be thinking of it as spatially
dependent optical index or spatially

426
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:21,260
依赖于介电常数，但考虑到它不会太错误
dependent dielectric constant but you
won't go too far wrong to think about it

427
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,220
就像粒子在您的材料中移动时的潜在潜力一样
as just a potential for particles as a
particle move through your material so

428
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,670
我们实际上会撒尿的方式我们实际上会计算出多少
the way we're gonna actually scat and
we're gonna actually calculate how much

429
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:33,910
散布在某个波矢K素上是使用费米黄金定律
gets scattered out at some wave vector K
prime is to use Fermi's Golden Rule

430
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:41,810
费米的黄金法则浓缩的笑话你知道这是一个象征
Fermi's golden rule rule condensed
matter joke you know this is a symbol

431
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:50,000
还是因为他们的钱是黄金，所以我当场弥补了这是因为我当时
for gold anyway their money so I made
that up on the spot it was because I was

432
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,260
试图挽救我的手臂，以免写错了，没关系，我不会成为一个
trying to save my arm from writing all
right never mind I'm not gonna be a

433
00:43:54,260 --> 00:44:01,030
喜剧演员这就是为什么我是物理学家，所以散射率散射率
comedian that's why I'm a physicist okay
so the scattering rate scattering rate

434
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:09,350
从K到K素数的振铃速率是由您给定的，您可能会看到费米的
ring rate from K to K prime is given by
you'll probably probably seen Fermi's

435
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:16,400
黄金法则h上的两个pi有一个矩阵元素K素数K 
golden rule two pi over h-bar there's a
matrix element K prime the K that gets

436
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:25,820
平方和一个能量守恒Delta函数能量守恒Delta 
squared and an energy preserving Delta
function energy preserving Delta

437
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:31,550
现在可以简化您的生活，我们假设我们假设有弹性
function now to simplify your life
we are going to assume we assume elastic

438
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:41,240
散射弹性散射，这意味着e等于E成为能量的主要来源
scattering elastic scatter which means
that e equals E prime the energy coming

439
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,750
进入和流出的能量是相同的，这也意味着绝对
in and the energy coming out are the
same that will also mean the absolute

440
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,340
 K的值等于K素数的绝对值
value of K equals the absolute value of
K prime there's several reasons why we

441
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,750
首先假设弹性散射，然后当您实际
assume elastic scattering first of all
it's easier secondly when you actually

442
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,780
做这些实验你实际测量的大部分散射是
do these experiments most of the
scattering that you measure actually is

443
00:44:56,780 --> 00:45:00,470
弹性，我对观察非弹性散射也很有趣
elastic is I did quite interesting to
look at inelastic scattering as well I

444
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,920
可能会提到一些关于非弹性散射的讲座
might mention that a couple of lectures
further on with the inelastic scattering

445
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,360
实际上，您会在样本中留下一些能量，而实际上
you actually get you leave some energy
behind in the sample and that actually

446
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,890
让您找出可能激发的能量是什么
allows you to figure out what the energy
of the possible excitations are that you

447
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:15,979
也可以使声音兴奋，但要多一点
can excite in the sound
as well but that's a little bit more

448
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:20,179
复杂，所以我们暂时不用担心，所以我们只是去
complicated so we're not gonna worry
about that for now so we're just going

449
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:23,359
假设弹性散射，唯一困难的是
to assume elastic scattering and the
only thing that's difficult in that

450
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:26,779
费米的黄金法则是矩阵元素，所以让我们写出
expression Fermi's golden rule is the
matrix elements so let's write out the

451
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:33,679
矩阵元素，所以我们有K个素数VK等于我们将使用实数
matrix element so we have K prime V K
equals what well we'll use the the real

452
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:41,629
这些猫的空间表示形式是e到罪恶e到e的积分
space representation of these cats it's
integral d dr of e to the sines e to the

453
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:51,709
 r乘以e到i k点的ik质点rv是正确的标志，是的， 
i k prime dot r v of r times e to the i
k dot are the signs right yeah okay and

454
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:55,219
如果您小心的话，我们会用1的平方根
if you were careful we would normalize
this with by 1 over square roots of

455
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:58,939
体积这是波向量这是波函数k素数这是
volumes this is a wave vector this is
the wave function k prime this is the

456
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:02,629
波动函数K在中间有R的V，我们意识到那是什么
wave function K there's V of R in the
middle and we realize that what that is

457
00:46:02,629 --> 00:46:12,769
很好地这样写d 3r e到负IK素数减K 
is well write this way d 3r e to the
minus I K prime minus K dotted with our

458
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:21,319
 R的V就是将其写为K减去K素数K减去V的旋转
V of R that is just what will write it
as V twiddle of K minus K prime K minus

459
00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:27,319
 V旋转为K的素数表示傅里叶变换等于傅立叶
K prime where V twiddle is means Fourier
transform be twiddle equals Fourier

460
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:33,259
 R的V的变换这是一个非常普遍的规则，即散射
transform of V of R this is a very very
general rule that the scattering

461
00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:37,099
从K到K素数的振幅只是散射的傅立叶变换
amplitude from K to K prime is just the
Fourier transform of the scattering

462
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:43,309
现在在上一堂课中具有潜力，因此这几乎总是
potential now in the last lecture and so
this that actually always almost always

463
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:46,669
对于您将要进行散射实验的任何事情都适用
holds true for anything that you're
going to do scattering experiments on

464
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:51,649
使用形式的散射是黄金法则
that the scattering using form is Golden
Rule the scattering amplitude from some

465
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:54,319
 K到K素数只是傅里叶变换或任何散射
K to K prime is just the Fourier
transform or whatever the scattering

466
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:00,709
潜力现在在上一讲中我们考虑了傅立叶变换
potential is now in the last lecture we
considered Fourier transforms of

467
00:47:00,709 --> 00:47:05,779
周期函数，所以我们假设我们有一个晶体，让我们假设
periodic functions so we're going to
assume we have a crystal let's assume a

468
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:10,579
 R的周期性周期性散射势V因此，如果我们有
periodic periodic scattering potential V
of R so if we have anything that's

469
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:16,909
结晶的潜力将是周期性的，因此我们可以使用以下定律
crystalline the potential will be
periodic and so we can use the law that

470
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:20,449
我们在上一讲中导出了周期的傅立叶变换
we derived in the last lecture if the
Fourier transform of a periodic

471
00:47:20,449 --> 00:47:26,109
势K减去K素数等于
potential K minus K prime equals

472
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:31,970
等于三角函数3的倒数晶格向量G的和
equals sum over a reciprocal lattice
vectors G of a delta function three

473
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:39,100
 K减去K素数的维度Delta函数K减去K素数减G 
dimensional Delta function of K minus K
prime again K minus K prime minus G

474
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,330
乘以GI的结构因子猜测有一些归一化因子2 PI 
times the structure factor of G I guess
there's some normalization factor 2 PI

475
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:53,300
求单位晶格体积本身的体积和结构因子的立方
cubed over the volume of the unit cell
volume itself and the structure factor

476
00:47:53,300 --> 00:48:04,730
这里的走出空间s的g等于积分，等于
here s of g o running out of space s of
g equals the integral it's equal to the

477
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:12,440
知道单位晶格积分d3内的傅立叶变换
Fourier transform within a unit cell
integral d3 are you know I I do dot R of

478
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,970
 R的V写入R的方式相同，并且在单位晶格上积分a 
V of R write the R is the same way and
it's integral over the unit cell ok a

479
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:25,460
这很重要，所以这是我们上次推导的法律
couple of important so this is a law
that we derived last time and a couple

480
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:31,550
关于这条法律的重要事实，我们上次首先提到
of important facts about this this law
we mentioned last time first of all the

481
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:36,910
除非我们查看，否则该周期函数的傅立叶变换为零
Fourier transform of this periodic
function is zero unless we're looking at

482
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:42,280
 K的值是倒数晶格向量的元素，所以0.1 
values of K which are elements of the
reciprocal lattice vector so 0.1

483
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:56,390
除非0减去K素数是倒数晶格，否则散射为0为0 
scattering is 0 is 0 unless unless K
minus K prime is a reciprocal lattice

484
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:04,570
向量G这是一个重要的框，称为低e条件
vector G this is important box around it
this is known as the low e condition

485
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:10,040
继马克·冯·劳埃二世（Max von Laue II）之后，他因在X射线中发现这一点而获得了诺贝尔奖
after Max von Laue II who won a Nobel
Prize for discovering this in x-ray

486
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,820
散布的诺贝尔奖实际上不时是一百年前
scattering Nobel Prize was actually
exactly a hundred years ago now and then

487
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,880
关于是否应将其称为“糟糕的条件”存在复杂性
there's this complication about whether
it should be called a lousy condition of

488
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,870
冯·劳厄（von Laue e）的病情，因为他出生于麦克斯洛（maxchloe），但后来他的父亲
the von Laue e condition because he was
born maxchloe but then his father was

489
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:28,490
后来升为贵族，他取了冯·劳埃二世的名字，但是当他
elevated to noble hood much later and he
took the name von Laue ii but when he

490
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:31,430
发现他的名字仍然是低e，所以通常称为低e 
discovered this his name was still low e
so it's usually called the low e

491
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:34,070
关于条件元音的条件，但其他人会
condition about the vowel i of
conditions but other people will

492
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:38,090
因此不同意，无论是von laue e条件的响亮状态，还是
disagree so anyway it's either loud
condition of von laue e condition and

493
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,430
但是我们在这是什么之前就已经看过了
but we've seen this thing before what
this is

494
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:47,500
是守恒的晶体动量守恒
is conservation of conservation of
crystal momentum

495
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:56,990
只有在您可以保留晶体动量的情况下，才散布
you only scatter if you can conserve
crystal momentum right K if K minus K

496
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:00,320
质数是互易的晶格矢量，可保持其晶体动量
prime is a reciprocal lattice vector
that conserves crystal momentum it

497
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,840
第二个重要事实是不会改变波浪的晶体动量
doesn't change the crystal momentum of
the wave the second important fact that

498
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,100
我们稍后将使用的是
we're going to use later is that the
intensity of scattering intensity of

499
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:20,090
我的散射是井Delta Delta K平方的结构因子s 
scattering I'm scatter is the structure
factor s of well Delta Delta K squared

500
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:25,010
这里的Delta K是你已经分散的倒数晶格矢量G 
where Delta K is the reciprocal lattice
vector G which you've scattered by okay

501
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:28,850
所以重点是，如果您测量各种散射的强度
so the point is that if you measure the
intensity of the various scatterings

502
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:33,050
您可以弄清楚要测量的结构因素是
you can figure out the structure factor
you what you're measuring is the

503
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:37,130
给定倒数晶格矢量的结构因子
structure factor at given reciprocal
lattice vectors the structure factor of

504
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,680
鉴于您在晶格因子处的典型R是
given your typical R at lattice factors
is the Fourier transform of the

505
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,760
散射势，所以原则上您正在测量散射
scattering potential so in principle
you're measuring the scattering

506
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,530
通过测量所散布的点来确定潜力
potential that's the point
by measuring the what is scattered

507
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:53,330
您实际上正在测量散射潜力，对不起，我要去了
you're actually measuring the scattering
potential now I'm sorry I'm going to go

508
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:58,520
在大约一分钟的时间里，这种情况似乎有些令人惊讶
over about one minute here it may seem a
little bit surprising this condition one

509
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,310
你只会在特定条件下散布
that you only get scattering under
certain conditions

510
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:07,790
只有满足了水晶的动量才满足
only if crystal momentum is satisfied
only if you if satisfy this lousy

511
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,570
现在看起来有些奇怪，但我要说服你
condition now that might seem a little
bit weird but I'm going to convince you

512
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:16,820
这是你非常了解的东西，所以想象你有一个水晶
that this is something that you know
very well so imagine you have a crystal

513
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:22,430
像这样，那么你想到的是，这确实是一堆晶格平面
like this then you think of there's a
really this is a bunch of lattice planes

514
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:26,600
这是一个晶格平面族，您将一些波发送到一个晶格家族中
it's a family of lattice planes and you
send some wave into a family of lattice

515
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,890
飞机，它会弹起，但它也可能从这一层弹起，你知道
planes and it bounces off but it could
bounce off this layer too and you know

516
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:34,550
很好，如果您像这样从平面上弹开，您会得到衍射和
very well that if you bounce off planes
like this you can get diffraction and

517
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:37,850
衍射仅在特定角度发生
diffraction only occurs at certain
angles

518
00:51:37,850 --> 00:51:41,270
您只会在某些角度获得建设性的干涉
you only get constructive interference
at certain angles and what we're going

519
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,680
看到的是，这种糟糕的情况实际上与
to see is that this lousy condition is
actually exactly the same condition as

520
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,400
有建设性的干涉，我们下次见到您时会做
having constructive interference and
we'll do that next time I see you

521
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,960
星期三[掌声]
