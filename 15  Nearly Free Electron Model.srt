1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
好吧，我想我们可以开始了欢迎回来这是第15场演讲
all right I guess we can get started
welcome back it's the 15th lecture of

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,670
最后一次我们离开的浓缩课程，我们正在谈论试图
the condensed matter course when last we
left off we were talking about trying to

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,540
近似求解固体中电子的薛定inger方程，并且
approximately solve the Schrodinger
equation for electrons in solids and the

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,550
我们正在讨论使用的方法是近乎自由电子模型
method we were talking about using was
the nearly free electron model nearly

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:26,130
自由电子的基本概念是，我们要写我们的哈密顿量
free electrons the general idea of being
that we're gonna write our Hamiltonian

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,579
就像一些裸露的规则无相互作用的电子平面波
as some bare just regular non
interacting electron plane wave

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,680
哈密​​顿量加上一些势，因此在平面波K中的本征态为
Hamiltonian plus some potential so the
eigenstates of this in a plane wave K is

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,750
 H bar平方K平方超过2m只是常规电子哈密顿量， 
H bar squared K squared over 2m just
your regular electron Hamiltonian but

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,390
那么在这里我们有一些周期性的潜力
then here we have some periodic
potential which we're going to

10
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,850
最终认为自己是弱者，因此这个名字几乎具有自由潜力和想法
eventually consider to be weak hence the
name nearly free potential and the idea

11
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:00,989
我们从散射理论中得出的结论是，一些K之间的矩阵元素
that we took from scattering theory is
that the matrix element between some K

12
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,619
如果K减去K素数不是一个整数，则该周期性势的K素数必须为0。 
and K prime from this periodic potential
has to be 0 if K minus K prime is not an

13
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,790
倒数晶格的元素，如果K素数减去K，我们将其称为V sub G 
element of the reciprocal lattice and
we'll call it V sub G if K prime minus K

14
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,710
互易晶格中是否存在元素，因此我们将
is there an element in reciprocal
lattice so then we treated the the

15
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,630
势v为弱摄动和二阶摄动理论
potential v as a weak perturbation and
in second-order perturbation Theory

16
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,439
二阶燃烧我们发现平面波K的能量开始为
second-order burn we found that the
energy of the plane wave K starts out as

17
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,960
平面波的裸能量K加V sub 0的零阶傅里叶模式
the bare energy of the plane wave K plus
V sub 0 the zeroth Fourier mode of the

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,100
势，这只是所有平面波能量的整体转移
potential it's just an overall shift of
all of the plane wave energies that's

19
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,490
无趣的人有时只是将它们放在一起，因为它只是一个常数
uninteresting people sometimes just drop
it all together cuz it's just a constant

20
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,720
但是有趣的是所有倒数晶格向量V的总和
but the interesting piece is the sum
over all reciprocal lattice vectors V

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:57,299
子G乘以K减去能量而不是K加G的平方，所以这是我们的
sub G squared over energy of K minus
energy not of K plus G so this is our

22
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,899
二阶摄动理论表达和必须要做的事情
second order perturbation Theory
expression and the thing that one has to

23
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,009
担心的是分母可以为零或接近零，并且
worry about is that the denominator can
be either zero or close to zero and that

24
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:15,890
当我们使K绝对K等于
happens when so this diverges
when we have K absolute K being equal to

25
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:22,250
绝对K加G使得K n ng k加G的能量相同，即
absolute K plus G so that the energy of
K n ng k plus G are the same and that is

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:30,320
等于k和k加G在易边界Braun上的相同条件
equal to the same condition as k and k
plus G being on on easy boundary Braun's

27
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:38,660
自己的边界，所以在这种情况下，我们的二阶摄动会出现问题
own boundary so in that case we have a
problem our second order perturbation

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,440
理论由于这种退化以及我们应该做的事情而无法工作
theory doesn't work because of this
degeneracy and what we're supposed to do

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:49,910
我们应该使用生成扰动理论来简并赫兹吗
is we're supposed to use the generate
perturbation theory degenerate Hertz

30
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:59,030
抵制所有关于堕落这个词开玩笑的理论可能有
theory resisting all urges to make jokes
about the word degenerate probably have

31
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,230
在简并扰动的一般规则之前被做了数百次
been made hundreds of times before the
general rules of degenerate perturbation

32
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,370
理论上是，您应该采取导致您麻烦的状态
theory are that you should take the
states that are causing you trouble the

33
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,190
使您与众不同的州将那些与众不同
states that are giving you the
divergence separate those out from all

34
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,220
系统中的其他州，并以此来困扰汉密尔顿
the other states in the system and just
to agonize the hamiltonian with this

35
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,050
在那些有问题的国家的空间内，所以对我们来说，我们的国家
within the space of those problematic
states so for us ours the states that

36
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:26,090
导致我们麻烦我们的州的K和K加G对于某些特定的G，所以我们会
are causing us trouble our state's K and
K plus G for some particular G so we'll

37
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,500
写我们的试验波函数，实际上可能会更通用一些
write our trial wave function actually
maybe will be a little bit more general

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:39,220
并假设K和K加G假设它们在棕色区域边界附近
and assume assume K and K plus G assume
these are near a brown zone boundary

39
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,190
 mihrab容易划分边界，因此它可能不会出现实际差异，而可能只是一个
mihrab easy boundary so it may not be in
an actual divergence it can just be an

40
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:52,250
耳朵发散仍然很严重，足以使我们不信任二阶
ear divergence it's still bad enough to
cause us to not trust our second-order

41
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,940
摄动理论不再存在，要求我们使用简并摄动理论
perturbation Theory anymore and require
us to use degenerate perturbation theory

42
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:59,450
即使不是分母，您也知道分母不是零
even though it's not a you know it's not
a zero in the denominator so something

43
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,470
分母接近零的一般方案是写一个试验波
close to zero in the denominator the
general scheme is to write a trial wave

44
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:11,450
功能，这将是一些有问题的猫，所以K和K加
function which is going to be some some
of the problematic cats so K and K plus

45
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,320
 G可能会取这两个值的线性和，并且我们通常会尝试
G will may take some linear sum of these
two and in the usual way we will try to

46
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,910
找到这两只猫的最佳线性组合
find the best linear combination of
these two cats

47
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,380
为了获得这个空间内的最低能量状态，所以我们做了一个
in order to get our lowest energy state
within this space so we've done this a

48
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,660
在做某事之前几次是写下哈密顿量
couple times before the way one does
that is you write down a Hamiltonian an

49
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:40,370
在m H和M Phi上的有效哈密顿方程总和等于e Phi，并且
effective Hamiltonian equation sum over
m H and M Phi M equals e Phi and this

50
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,150
从解决紧密绑定模型时所做的事情中应该看起来很熟悉
should look familiar from what we did
when we solved the tight binding model

51
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,360
对于共价键的共价键，此hmm是一个二乘二矩阵
for the covalent for the covalent bond
here this hmm is a two by two matrix

52
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:57,740
从k和k加G中选择N和M，这就是您的操作方式
where N and M are chosen from k and k
plus G this is how you how you do the

53
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:01,010
一般微扰理论，您只是将状态空间限制为
general perturbation Theory you just
restrict the space of states to the

54
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:05,120
在第二级引起麻烦的退化国家的空间
space of degenerate States who are
causing trouble in the second-order

55
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,110
摄动理论没事，所以我们现在要做的唯一一件事就是
perturbation theory all right so the
only thing we need to do now in order to

56
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,710
遵循这个规定是我们需要写出矩阵元素H 
follow this prescription is we need to
write out the matrix elements H so for

57
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:23,300
例如，我们有KHK是四个矩阵元素之一，我们可以这样写
example we have K H K that's one of the
four matrix elements we can write that

58
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:33,440
作为KH零K加KVK，因为我们的哈密顿量由H零组成
as K H naught K plus K V K since our
Hamiltonian is made up of the H naught

59
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,340
部分和V部分这部分很容易这只是一个K结
part and the V part this part is easy
this is just a knot of K and this part

60
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:45,740
 V是零，只是整体恒定的能量位移，这下标是
is V naught just the overall constant
energy shift this together subscript is

61
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:58,400
 0，因为K减去K素数是0，类似地，k加ghk加G等于e naught 
0 because K minus K prime is 0 similarly
k plus g h k plus G is equal to e naught

62
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,380
的k加G加V之和再次无效
of k plus G Plus V naught again the more
interesting term is the term the off

63
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:13,850
 2 x 2矩阵k加上GH的对角项，所以让我们写出
diagonal terms of the 2 by 2 matrix k
plus G H okay so let's write out the the

64
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:22,610
这部分我们有第一个k加GH没关系，第二个是K 
pieces of this we have first k plus G H
naught okay and the second piece is K

65
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:32,930
再加上GV好吧，第一部分很容易，因为这将是H否K 
plus G V ok well the first part this is
easy because this would be H naught K is

66
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,810
 H的本征态，所以我们可以拉出一个
an eigenstate of H naught so we can just
pull out an

67
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:42,500
不是子K并得到K加G好的，但这是零，因为它们是两个正交的
not sub K and get K plus G okay but this
is zero because these are two orthogonal

68
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,590
平面波，所以它是零，第一项是0第二项是我们定义的
plane waves so it's zero the first term
is 0 the second term is we've defined

69
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:56,030
由于它是V sub G，所以我们被允许通过k从k分散到k加G 
that as being V sub G so we're allowed
to scatter from k to k plus G via the

70
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:02,380
分散电势G并向上移动到顶部oops我将其滚动到顶部
scattering potential G and up way up at
the top oops I scrolled it off the top

71
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,370
 [音乐]是的，它在D sub G的顶部
[Music]
yeah there it is on the top the D sub G

72
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,430
的K减去K的素数是G的元素，所以我们称这个东西为V sub G，所以我们
of K minus K prime is an element of G so
we call this thing V sub G so so what we

73
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,320
现在也是如此，这件事将是整体，这将是V sub 
have now is also so this thing is going
to be overall this is going to be V sub

74
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:27,200
 G，我们可以做另一个最后一个矩阵元素HK加G 
G and we can do the other last matrix
element H K plus G which using the same

75
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:33,590
自变量是负G或负G星
argument is the sub minus G or the sub G
star

76
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,030
这是它的合作伙伴的复杂共轭，所以现在我们有了
it's a complex conjugate of its of its
partner up here so now we have our

77
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:45,280
哈密​​顿方程我们的2 x 2矩阵，我们可以记下e结为K + V结
Hamiltonian our 2 by 2 matrix we can
write down which is e knot of K + V knot

78
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:59,150
我们从这里开始有V sub G，从这里开始有V sub G，然后没有N + K + G + V 
we have V sub G here start here V sub G
down here and e naught K + G + V not so

79
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,070
太好了，每个人对此或多或少都感到满意，只是过快了
far so good everyone happy with this
more or less just go by too quickly

80
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,380
是的，幸福，好，好的，所以对于家庭作业和问题集4我
yeah happy ok good all right so for
homework and what's problem set 4 I

81
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,910
认为您通常会在地面附近的K上实际解决此问题
think you're going to actually solve
this in general for a K near the ground

82
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,020
区域边界使代数更加复杂，但是
zone boundary which makes the algebra a
little bit more complicated but what

83
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,590
我们要在这里做我们要简化我们的代数
we're gonna do here is we're gonna
simplify our algebra a little bit and

84
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:29,180
假设K在棕色区域边界上正确假设K和K加G我们在BZ上
assume K is right on the brown zone
boundary assume K and K plus G our on BZ

85
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:36,860
 BZ边界上的边界只是使代数更容易一点，所以
boundary on BZ boundary just to make the
algebra a little bit easier so that

86
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:44,480
表示II不等于K等于e不等于k加G相同的能量
means that II not of K equals e not of k
plus G the same energy so right on the

87
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,610
简并点，在这种情况下，这是一个非常简单的矩阵
degeneres point in which case this is a
very simple matrix has to

88
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:52,670
沿对角线然后复共轭的元素相同
elements which are the same along the
diagonal and then complex conjugate

89
00:08:52,670 --> 00:09:00,130
非对角线上的矩阵元素和能量是II而不是K 
matrices elements on the off diagonal
and the energies are then II not of K

90
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:08,750
加V而不是加或减绝对VG，这就是我们的答案，那么这是什么
plus V not plus or minus absolute V G
and that's our answer so what is this

91
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,450
这是什么意思，让我们也许在这里画出来，所以我们有
what does this mean
let's maybe draw it here so we have

92
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:21,860
这是K这是能量E，在添加扰动之前，我们有一个很好的
here's K here's energy E and before we
add the perturbation we have a nice

93
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:30,190
抛物线我们通常画它，所以这是通常的抛物线
parabola we have the usual draw it this
so this is the usual parabola which is a

94
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:38,060
 K的点数等于H bar平方K平方超过2m，所以这是自由电子
nod of K equals H bar squared K squared
over 2m so that's the free electron

95
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:45,589
抛物线，那么我们可以放下它具有一定布朗区的周期性势
parabola then we can put down the
periodic potential it has some Bron zone

96
00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,000
边界，所以我在PI上有一些晶格常数柏林区域边界
boundary for this so I had some lattice
constant a Berlin zone boundaries at PI

97
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,899
在负PI上，除了在a和负2 PI处有更多的*区域边界
over a minus PI over a except more bran
zone boundaries at minus 2 PI over a and

98
00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:02,720
 2 PI在此处，因此此处此处的*区域边界减去PI在
2 PI over a here so here at this point
there's bran zone boundary minus PI over

99
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,940
 a和PI在a上，您可以通过此倒易的晶格矢量G散布在它们之间
a and PI over a you can scatter between
them by this reciprocal lattice vector G

100
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:14,720
等于PI超过a可以使您从负PI减去2超过PI的秒数
equals to PI over a can get you from
minus PI over a 2 PI over a so in second

101
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,110
阶次扰动理论如果您分析了这一点，您会发现
order perturbation Theory you would
discover that if you if you analyze this

102
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,079
指向此处或指向此处，您将在第二阶出现分歧
point here or this point here you would
get divergence in second order

103
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:25,310
扰动理论，我们将不得不使用简并扰动理论
perturbation Theory and we would have to
use degenerate perturbation theory in

104
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,470
为了弄清楚这些点发生了什么，我们得出的是
order to figure out what happens to
these points and what we just derived is

105
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,899
事实上，他们在能量上的分裂以及它看起来的方式是
it in fact they split in energy and the
way it's going to look is that this is

106
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:40,279
会向下移动，然后会向上移动一点，因此实际上
going to shift down and then this will
shift up a little bit so that in fact

107
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:44,480
您会在左侧的东西之间拉开一点缝隙
you open up a little gap between the
things coming from the left of the

108
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,519
东西从右边进来，它的大小是-绝对VG在这里和相同
things coming in from the right and it's
size is - absolute VG here and the same

109
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:57,649
事情在这边发生，像这样扩大了大小的差距-绝对
thing happens over on this side like
this opens up a gap of size - absolute

110
00:10:57,649 --> 00:11:05,850
 VG和同样的事情会在这里发生，您可以从Braun的身上散开
VG and the same thing would happen up
here where you can scatter from Braun's

111
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,129
自己的边界布劳恩自己的边界G等于a上的四个PI，这里是一个间隙
own boundaries Braun's own boundary by G
equals four PI over a and here a gap

112
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,940
会在这里的青铜器边界处打开，而间隙会在
would open up at the bronze own boundary
here and the gap would open up at the

113
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,740
这里是青铜自己的边界，所以自从我画得很糟以来
bronze own boundary here okay so since
I've drawn that fairly badly I was

114
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,470
为此做准备，我有一张幻灯片，所以这是同一张照片的扩展区域
prepared for this and I have a slide so
here's the same picture an extended zone

115
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:34,079
方案这是从抛物线开始的，漂亮的自由电子
scheme this is the starts with the bare
parabola the the nice free electron

116
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,009
抛物线，然后当您添加周期性电势时， 
parabola and then when you add the
periodic potential the major effect of

117
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:41,339
周期性电势接近其打开的男爵区边界
the periodic potential is near the
barone zone boundary where it opens up

118
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:44,970
这个间隙，您会注意到青铜自身边界内的状态
this gap you notice that the states
inside the bronze own boundary get

119
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,029
降低一点能量，如果
pushed down in energy by a little bit
and they get pushed down more if they're

120
00:11:48,029 --> 00:11:51,300
更接近青铜器自身的边界，因为当您接近青铜器时
closer to the bronze own boundary
because as you're close to the bronze

121
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,060
如果您以二阶微扰理论来思考的话，那就是自己的边界
own boundary if you think in second
order perturbation theory that's where

122
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,850
分歧越来越严重，实际上并没有
the divergence is getting worse and
worse and worse it doesn't actually

123
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,810
分歧，但随着您的不断变化，扰动变得越来越重要
diverge but still the perturbation is
becoming more and more important as you

124
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:03,839
更加接近青铜器自身的边界-间隙使事物被压低
get closer to the bronze own boundaries
- the gap opens things get pushed down

125
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,800
当您接近青铜器自己的边界时，还有更多，然后如果您就在外面
more as you get close to the bronze own
boundary and then if you're just outside

126
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,680
青铜器本身的边界物体被推高，而您打开这小块
the bronze own boundary things get
pushed up and you open up this little

127
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,939
在柏林区域边界的差距现在这里完全相同
gap at the Berlin zone boundary same
thing over here now we're perfectly

128
00:12:14,939 --> 00:12:19,920
有权在缩小区域方案中查看相同的内容
entitled to view the same thing in
reduced zone scheme where we take this

129
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,899
频谱，我们将其移了两个pi，所以就在这里
piece of the spectrum and we shift it
over by two pi over a so it's over here

130
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:28,230
然后，我们利用这一频谱范围，将两个PI移到一个
and we take this piece of this spectrum
we shifted over by two PI over a in the

131
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,470
另一个方向，直到它在这里，我们在第一个视图中查看所有内容
other direction until it's over here and
we view everything within the first

132
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,230
布里渊区，但现在我们在第一个青铜区中有两个乐队
Brillouin zone but now we have two bands
within the first bronze zone so we have

133
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,160
最低的频段，我们有一个较高的频段，这看起来有点像我们
a lowest band and we have a higher band
and this looks a little bit like what we

134
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,519
在几周前研究紧束缚模型时发现
found when we studied the tight binding
model in a couple weeks back we handle

135
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:51,089
因为当我们每个晶胞有两个轨道时，在两个值处有两个波段
for when we had two orbitals per unit
cell there were two bands at two values

136
00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:55,730
在每个可能的K值处有两个本征态
of two eigenstates at each possible
value of K which is what we have here

137
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:01,110
并且结构看起来或多或少相似，我们有一个低频段，一个高频段，然后一个
and the structure looks more or less
similar we have a low band a high then a

138
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,579
棕色区域边界处的缝隙开口，但是我们实际上是从
gap opening at the brown zone boundary
however we're really coming at this from

139
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:09,480
当我们进行紧密绑定模型时，这是一个非常互补的方向，我们从
a very complementary direction when we
did tight binding model we started by

140
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,380
取一堆轨道，然后我们将它们弱耦合在一起，并允许
taking a bunch of orbitals and then we
weakly coupled them together and allow

141
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,960
电子从一个轨道到另一个轨道
the electrons to
from one orbital to the next to the next

142
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,610
在这里，我们做的是相反的，我们从平面波开始，然后我们对其进行了微弱的扰动。 
here we did the opposite we started with
a plane wave and we weakly perturbed it

143
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,480
具有周期性的电势，但是无论用哪种方式观察，都可以得到相同的物理场
with a periodic potential but either way
you look at it you get the same physics

144
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,750
如果您从柏林的边界区域中分离出不同的带隙
of separate bands gaps at the Berlin
zone boundary if you look at it from the

145
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,950
几乎免费的电子模型，虽然实际上这张图片可以在这张图片中看到
nearly free electron model though really
this picture you can see in this picture

146
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,710
这实际上是一个自由电子抛物线，在
it's it's actually just a free electron
parabola with small perturbations at at

147
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,620
柏林地区的边界，所以这种抛物线在
the Berlin zone boundaries so this
parabola is sort of continued in the

148
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,520
第二个乐队，所以这片抛物线星反射回来， 
second band so this this piece of the
parabola star reflected back and

149
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,030
继续第二个乐队，因为差距，他们不太感动
continuing the second band they don't
quite touch because of the the gap

150
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:56,250
打开，但实际上给出了该带在底部附近的曲率
opening up but the curvature of this
band near the bottom is actually given

151
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:00,420
由自由电子质量引起底部弯曲的事物
by the free electron mass the thing that
causes the curvature at the bottom of

152
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,770
你的抛物线取决于自由电子质量而不是其他任何东西
your parabola that's dependent on the
free electron mass not on anything else

153
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,580
所以我们真的应该查看乐队的这个底部，看起来像一个
so we really should view this this
bottom of the band which looks like a

154
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,280
抛物线基本上就是自由电子，所以这个问题是
parabola is just being essentially free
electrons okay so a question that's

155
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:20,630
在这一点上相当重要的是，也许我将其放在这里是为什么差距
fairly important at this point is maybe
I'll put it over here is why the gap why

156
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:28,530
差距介意差距为何差距还可以，所以才能理解为什么
the gap mind the gap why the gap okay so
in order to understand why it is that

157
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,980
这种差距正在以另一种语言在柏林地区边界开放
this gap is opening up at the Berlin
zone boundary in a different language

158
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:39,840
举个例子很有用，这样可以检查一个特定的潜力
it's useful to to give an example so
examine a particular potential I'll

159
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,170
选择X的V，我们将在一维中执行此操作实际上这是一个
choose V of X and we're gonna do this in
one dimension actually this is one

160
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,290
维度我还应该提到，这不是一个维度
dimension also I should have mentioned
that this isn't one dimension this is

161
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,850
更重要的是，这是一个更通用的方程式
more this is a more general equation
which all hold in any dimension we're

162
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,950
我们也要在一维上做这个例子，所以X的V我们选择它为2 
gonna do this example in one dimension
also so V of X we'll choose it to be two

163
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,850
 V旋转余弦2pi超过X倍，这是一个很好的周期性电势
V twiddle cosine 2pi over a times X
that's a nice periodic potential maybe

164
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,570
我什至会得出每个人可能都知道它看起来什么样的周期性潜力
I'll even draw that periodic potential
everyone probably knows what it looks

165
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:14,310
喜欢，但我还是会画它，好吧，这是我们的X是X也许我们会在这里放一个
like but I'll draw it anyway so okay
here's our X is X maybe we'll put a here

166
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:25,110
减去这里，余弦势看起来像这样，看起来像这样
minus a out here and a cosine potential
looks like this and looks like this

167
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:33,390
因此，这是X的V，晶格常数是a，周期是a和
so this is V of X and the lattice
constant is a the periodicity is a and

168
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,430
之所以选择这种特殊的简单余弦势，是因为它
the reason I've chosen this particular
simple cosine potential is because it

169
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:47,220
具有很好的傅立叶模式v等于V的sub 2pi等于v的负sub 2pi 
has nice Fourier modes v sub 2pi over a
equals V sub minus 2pi over a equals V

170
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:56,040
旋转，所有其他所有V sub G等于0，所以它只有两个
twiddle and all other all other V sub G
are equal to 0 so it only has two

171
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,180
非零的傅立叶模式，它们都由V旋转梗死给定
Fourier modes which are nonzero and
they're both given by V twiddle alright

172
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:06,300
所以现在让我们考虑一下这将要做的事
so now let's think about what this is
going to do what this can do is it can

173
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,780
 V sub G的散射仅对G而言是2 pi，因此在此图片中表示
scatter by V sub G only for G is 2 pi
over a so in this picture it means it

174
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,790
可以从这个点散布到这个点4到G这是两个点
can scatter from this point to this
point 4 by G these are the two points in

175
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:21,090
退化摄动理论，他们可以彼此混合，这就是重点
degenerative perturbation theory they
can mix with each other that's point

176
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:25,230
 K等于a的负PI，K等于a的正PI，所以散射
that K equals minus PI over a and K
equals plus PI over a so the scattering

177
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:33,060
我们要担心的是k等于a上的PI减去PI，而2 K等于PI上的PI 
we have to worry about is from k equals
minus PI over a and 2 K equals plus PI

178
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,000
被这个电位来回散布，因此它可以向后散射
over a being scattered back and forth by
this potential so it can scatter back

179
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,990
在青铜器本身上的两个波矢量之间来回
and forth between those two wave vectors
which are right on the bronze own

180
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:49,020
边界，所以在现实空间中，如果我考虑这些的XK表示
boundary so in in real space if I think
about X K representations of these of

181
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:57,330
这些猫是X上的I PI，e上是减去I PI的e 
these cats these things are either the I
PI over a X and e to the minus I PI over

182
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:04,140
 X，如果我们将这个哈密顿量对角化
a X and I'll use that notation if we
then diagonalize this Hamiltonian in

183
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,930
那就是在这个空间中，我们将得到两个特征值或
that and that's in this space what we'll
get is we'll get our two eigenvalues or

184
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:16,560
我们这边的两个本征函数将是e VI pi over ax加e到负I 
two eigenfunctions our side plus will be
e VI pi over a x plus e to the minus I

185
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:27,329
 X上的PI及其能量E Plus在零加V旋转条件下为e sub pi， 
PI over a X and it's energy E Plus is e
sub pi over a naught plus V twiddle and

186
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:34,560
另一个本征符号减号是e到I PI，而X减号e是到负I 
the other eigenstate sign minus is e to
the I PI over a X minus e to the minus I

187
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:40,669
 PI超过X且其能量为e-PI高于零
PI over a X
and it's energy e - is e naught PI over

188
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:46,429
负V旋转，所以这些平面的这些线性组合之一
a minus V twiddle so one of these linear
combinations of these of these plane

189
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,970
波浪的能量被推高其中之一被能量的推低
waves is getting pushed up in energy one
of them is getting pushed down in energy

190
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,100
由V旋转，所以我们又有了这两个平面波
by V twiddle so again we have these two
plane waves one going left one going

191
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,299
正确的是，他们被这种散射的潜力混合在一起
right they're getting mixed together by
the by this by this scattering potential

192
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,860
通过这种周期性的潜能和两个本征态之一
by this periodic potential and one of
the two eigenstates this has been pushed

193
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,130
增强能量其中一个被降低了能量为什么我们要
up an energy one of them has been pushed
down in energy why is that well let's

194
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:13,220
看看我们是否能弄清楚，让我们将边+平方，然后我们得到
see if we can figure that out
let's take side + square it so we get

195
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,330
概率密度，所以这是密度，问题概率密度
the probability density so this is the
density the problem probability density

196
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,210
概率密度sy +平方，建议的部分全部-余弦平方
prob density sy + squared which is
proposed portion all - cosine squared of

197
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:34,010
 PI在ax + sy-平方上与PI over的正弦平方成比例
PI over ax + sy - squared will be
proportional to sine squared of PI over

198
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:42,559
一个X，让我们在同一图上画出它们，让我们看一下sy +看起来像这样
a X and let's plot those on this same
figure so let's see sy + looks like this

199
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:59,110
它的余弦平方为SI +平方，然后为sy-看起来像这叹气-平方
it's cosine squared of SI + squared and
then sy - looks like this sigh - squared

200
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:03,770
看起来像这样，所以它们的幅度误差概率密度在
looks like that so they have their
amplitude err probability density is in

201
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:09,350
沿着位置空间的不同地方
different places along the in the
positional space there different places

202
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:16,730
沿轴，因此侧面加平方的角度使我
along the axis and because of this the
side plus squared sees I'm putting that

203
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:27,620
用引号引起来的X大多是正VV，因此您可以看到sy +的优势所在
in quotes sees mostly positive V V of X
so you see where where sy + is great

204
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,610
 X的V为正且很大的地方
where it's very large
that's where V of X is positive and

205
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,890
我们在里面+小是X的V为负的地方，这意味着边加E 
we're inside + is small is where V of X
is negative so that means side plus E

206
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:44,299
 Plus被推高了，能量被推高了，因为它主要经历了
Plus is pushed up in energy is pushed up
because it's experiencing mostly the

207
00:19:44,299 --> 00:19:50,210
正电位，而正弦减去平方
positive potential whereas in comparison
sine minus squared

208
00:19:50,210 --> 00:20:04,710
大部分搜索X的负VV，因为sy-大，而X的V恰好是
sieze mostly negative V V of X because
sy- is large where V of X happens to be

209
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:15,450
负数，所以它被降低了u负数的能量被降低了，所以让我们
negative and so it's pushed down u minus
is pushed down down in energy so let's

210
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:19,350
仔细考虑一下，这是怎么回事
think about this a little bit more
carefully so what's going on is we have

211
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,429
这个空间有向左波和向右波，这是
this space which has a left going wave
and a right going wave that's the the

212
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:27,179
简并摄动理论的空间
space of the degenerate perturbation
theory and you know with the variational

213
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:30,120
原则上我们应该做的是将它们放在一起
principle what we're supposed to do is
we're supposed to put them together in a

214
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,059
你会知道如何获得基态的方法
way that will you know to get the ground
state we're supposed to put them

215
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:36,510
一起以最小化总能量和最小化方式
together in a way that will minimize the
total energy and the way you minimize

216
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:40,380
获得基态的总能量是将它们放在一起
the total energy to get the ground state
is you put them together such that you

217
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,720
得到一个符号-因为符号-在X的V为负且
get a sign - because sign - has its
maximum where V of X is negative and

218
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,290
降低了能量，因此在其中将其降低了
that pushes down its energy therefore
it's in it pushes it down as much as

219
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,780
因此，这可能是我可以陈述的基态，反之，sy + 
possible therefore it's the ground state
I can state and conversely sy+

220
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,620
通过投入尽可能多地提高其能量
has pushed up its energy as much as
possible as high as possible by putting

221
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:02,970
势为正的密度，那么为什么
its density where the potential is
positive so is that clear what why

222
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:10,080
一切都很好，所以你读过检查员的报告吗
that's going on alright good so do you
ever read the examiner reports people

223
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,940
阅读考官的报告，您从来没有注意到它真的很讨厌，我认为这是
read the examiner reports you've never
notice that really nasty I think it's an

224
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,660
书面要求审查员报告必须真的很讨厌
unwritten requirement the examiner
reports have to be really nasty I've

225
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,770
从来没有参加过考试委员会，但是有一天我会来的，我会
never been on the examination committee
yet one day my time will come and I'll

226
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,270
可能会在平板电脑上某处读到该规则的未成文规则
probably read the rule the unwritten
rule somewhere on some tablet that says

227
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,620
你一定很讨厌，所以这几乎引起了一个问题
you must be nasty okay so there was a
question that came up about this nearly

228
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,850
自由电子模型大约是在四年前出现的，它真的引发了很多
free electron model came up about four
years ago and it really threw a lot of

229
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,669
人，所以我要经历那里所涉及的物理学
people so I'm gonna go through the
physics of what was involved in there

230
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,270
这并不比我们做的复杂得多，但是
which isn't too much more complicated
than what we did but but it's something

231
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,299
你知道很多人都觉得很意外，所以我要
that you know a lot of people found
rather unexpected so I'm going to

232
00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:53,280
或多或少地解释该问题发生了什么，所以当您遇到
explain more or less what what was going
on in that problem so when you run into

233
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,520
有一天它不会打扰您，所以我们将考虑一个正方形
it someday it won't trouble you so we're
going to consider a square

234
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,410
二维晶格，我正在画一个倒数空间，这是倒数
two-dimensional lattice and I'm drawing
reciprocal space this is a reciprocal

235
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:09,179
格子2D这个正方形2D格子和
lattice so Square 2d
this Square 2d lattice and the

236
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,110
正方形格子的倒数空间也是正方形，所以我要画
reciprocal space of a square lattice is
also square so I'm going to draw the

237
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,940
棕熊拥有，所以这里的K等于零，第一个铜牌拥有
Bruins own so this is K equals zero here
in the center and the first bronze own

238
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:29,090
这里是这个广场，拐角处的这个点是PI超过8 pi超过8 ok 
is this square here and this point here
in the corner is PI over 8 pi over 8 ok

239
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:33,480
现在，这个问题要求您要做的第一件事就是找出当
now the first thing this question asked
you to do is find out what happens when

240
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,500
您添加了周期性电势，在青铜板上的某个点会发生什么
you add a periodic potential what
happens to a point here on the bronze

241
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,730
自己确定边界，所以基本上这就是我们刚才所做的
own boundary ok so that's basically
exactly what we just did

242
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:45,960
由于周期性的电位，它可以与该点混合
that point there due to the periodic
potential it can mix in with this point

243
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,520
在这里，这两个点被倒易的晶格矢量隔开，这是一个
over here these two points are separated
by a reciprocal lattice vector this is a

244
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:57,059
倒数晶格矢量2 pi超过a的2 pi，因此这两个可以通过
reciprocal lattice vector 2 pi over 2 pi
over a so these two can mix together via

245
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,169
散射它们具有相同的能量，因为它们与k的距离相同
scattering they have the same energy
because they're the same distance from k

246
00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:08,250
等于0，它们具有与k相同的振幅，所以此条件保持EK 
equals 0 they have the same amplitude of
their k so so this condition holds EK

247
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:13,740
等于ek加G，所以它们混合在一起，这是我们完全相同的计算
equals ek plus G so they mix together
and it's exactly the same calculation we

248
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:17,580
只是做到了，只是您知道这实际上是一个二维模型，但我们只是
just did it's just you know it's really
a two dimensional model but we're just

249
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,640
考虑到切穿的二维，将会有一个缺口
considering this cut through two
dimensions there will be a gap opening

250
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,610
在这一点上，在柏林区域边界上
up at the Berlin zone boundary at this
point at this point so that much is

251
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,940
简单还是应该简单我希望它就像我们两次做的一样
simple or should be simple I hope it's
exactly like what we did in two

252
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,690
一维和一维，但现在在二维中， 
dimensions and in one dimension but now
in two dimensions the thing that was

253
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,260
如果您在此处考虑这一点，将会发生复杂的情况
complicated is what happens if you
consider this point up here in the

254
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,669
拐角处，所以这称为两点一，所以现在我们要做的是
corner so it's called this point two
point one so now what we have to do is

255
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,539
我们必须问他们在哪里做的分歧在哪里
we have to ask where do they do where do
the divergences come in second order

256
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:46,830
扰动理论很好，这一点人们可以被倒易的晶格散射
perturbation theory well this point one
can scatter by a reciprocal lattice

257
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,909
向量到第二点，但它也可以通过倒数晶格向量进行散布
vector to this point two but it can also
scatter by a reciprocal lattice vector

258
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:54,990
至第三点，这也是至此的倒数晶格向量
to this point three and this is also a
reciprocal lattice vector to this point

259
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,740
四个，实际上是分叉柜分散了两个三四个可以分散到
four and in fact forking cabinets
scatter two three four can scatter to

260
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,799
两个可以分散到三个，它们都可以通过倒数彼此分散
two can scatter to three they can all
scatter to each other by reciprocal

261
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,130
格向量那些在k空间中的向量都是倒数格向量
lattice vectors those vectors in k space
are all reciprocal lattice vectors and

262
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,730
他们都被允许彼此混合，并且在拥有相同能量之前
they're all allowed to mix to each other
and they all have the same energy before

263
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,390
您添加扰动，所以当您进行简并扰动理论时
you add the perturbation so when you do
your degenerate perturbation theory

264
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,900
您会发现一堆这些东西，所有这些分母
you'll find a bunch of these things the
bunch of these denominators that are all

265
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,460
零，如果您正在考虑这一点
zero
okay if you're considering this point

266
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,400
散射到这里分母为零散射到这里
scattering to here there'll be a
denominator zero scattering here

267
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,720
零散在这里，所以你要处理的方法是你必须写你的
scattering here all zero so the way you
handle this is you have to write your

268
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:33,549
试用波函数，它包括试验，它包括所有这些波向量，所以我
trial wavefunction it includes trial it
includes all of these wave vectors so I

269
00:24:33,549 --> 00:24:44,919
想要1加披披2 K 2 + 5 3 K 3 + 5 4 K，因为所有这些事情
want a 1 plus Phi 2 K 2 + 5 3 K 3 + 5 4
K for all of these things have to be

270
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,110
包含在您的试验波函数中，然后您的哈密顿量就是4乘4 
included in your trial wavefunction and
then your Hamiltonian is then a 4 by 4

271
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:56,320
矩阵，其中包括您如何来回分散的所有可能性
matrix which includes all possibilities
of how you scatter back and forth

272
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,480
在所有这四个点之间都可以，所以这就是
between all those four points okay so
that was what was what was asked on the

273
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,010
在考试中，即使不是
in the in the exam and a lot of people
got thrown by it even though it's not

274
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,169
真的要复杂得多，好吧，好吧，让我们开始吧
really that much more complicated okay
good happy with that all right let's do

275
00:25:11,169 --> 00:25:18,700
我们在这里做一个真实的例子，所以在3D真实的例子中，我们有很多东西
it let's do a real example here so in 3d
in real example real life we have things

276
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,279
就像FCC格子一样，就像我们几天前讨论的那样
like FCC lattices this is as we
discussed a couple days ago this is the

277
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,120
 FCC晶格的青铜区，伽玛点是K中等于0的点
bronze zone of the FCC lattice the gamma
point is a point at K equals zero in the

278
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,470
 x点的中间是此正方形中间的柏林区域边界
middle the x point is at the Berlin zone
boundary in the middle of this square

279
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:37,059
面对此处，L点位于KX方向，位于柏林区域边界
face here and the K X direction the L
point is in the Berlin zone boundary in

280
00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:40,899
例如，该六边形表面的中间以及我们要使用的材料
the middle of this hexagonal face for
example and the material we're going to

281
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:46,390
考虑一下实际上是材料碳化硅
think about is the material silicon
carbide silicon carbide it's actually

282
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,740
这是另一种重要的工业材料，它具有这种结构
it's another important industrial
material it has this structure here it's

283
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,270
 FCC有一个基础，因此黄色是硅的，蓝色是
FCC with a basis so the yellows are
silicon's and the and the Blues are

284
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:00,520
碳可以在0 0 0处取，碳可以在1/4 1/4 1/4处取
carbon the silicon can be taken at 0 0 0
and the carbon at 1/4 1/4 1/4 we've seen

285
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,630
这是之前的这种结构Vinc混合结构硫化锌镓
this structure before this is this Vinc
blend structure zinc sulfide gallium

286
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,720
砷化物具有相同的结构，因此碳化物具有这种结构
arsenide takes the same structure
so looking carbide takes this structure

287
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:15,789
这是非常常见的结构，现在可以了，所以在这里让我们看看是否可以
it's very common structure ok now all
right so here let's see if we can we can

288
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:19,120
了解这张照片如何显示所有本征的复杂照片
understand how this picture this
complicated picture of all the eigen

289
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,950
电子的状态可以来自几乎自由的电子模型，所以让我们
States for electrons can come out of
nearly free electron models so let's

290
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:27,280
低头看最低的能量这里的最低能量
look down at the lowest energy the
lowest energy here and we have the gamma

291
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:31,300
点在K等于0是，电缆0的另一个名称
point that's at K equals 0 yeah
another name for cable zero and as you

292
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,810
在柏林地区朝X点走出去，你会看到
go out in the Berlin zone towards the
point X you see this thing that looks

293
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:38,860
有点像抛物线，如果你备份，那很糟糕
kind of like parabola and if you back up
that's oops back back back back back

294
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:46,210
这里看起来有点像抛物线，这就是
here so it looks kind of like this
parabola here and that's exactly what

295
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,600
你在这里看到这是从K出来的自由电子抛物线
you're seeing here this is the free
electron parabola coming out from K

296
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,200
等于零，当您到达青铜自己的边界时，会有一个间隙
equals zero and when you get to the
bronze own boundary there's a gap

297
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,190
打开，这是抛物线的后半部分在他的背上
opening up and this is the second half
of the parabola going up around his back

298
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,230
回来不在这里，所以这里是抛物线的后半部分
back back not there here it is so here's
the second half of the parabola up here

299
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,180
就像抛物线的后半部分在这里一样，您可以进入
just like the second half of the
parabola is here and you could go off in

300
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,870
另一个方向，所以从伽玛到L点再一次
another direction so going from gamma
out to the L point again you have a

301
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,190
抛物线，这是L方向的较大缝隙，这是第二个
parabola and this is slightly bigger gap
in the L direction and here's the second

302
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,390
抛物线的一半在这里还可以，所以基本上是自由电子模型，如果
half of the parabola here okay so it's
basically free electron model and if you

303
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,190
在波段底部向下测量曲率，您的伽玛等于零， 
measure the curvature down at the bottom
of the band your gamma equals zero you

304
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:27,790
基本上得到自由电子的质量，这不完全是
get basically the mass of the free
electron it's not exactly the mass of

305
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,240
自由电子，但它非常接近自由电子的质量
the free electron but it's it's pretty
close to the mass of the free electron

306
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,960
在30％或20％之内，所以它确实告诉您
within 30 percent or 20 percent or
something so so it really tells you that

307
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,740
底部附近发生了什么，基本上是自由平面波物理学
what's going on near the bottom there is
basically free plane wave physics just

308
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:45,280
 X点散射您的散射电位使它稍微受到干扰
perturbed slightly by the scattering
potential that the X point scatters you

309
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,970
跨越Brauns自己并打开了这个缺口
across the Brauns own and opens up this
gap is that clear so far all right so

310
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,450
大约六年前，我们的考试题目非常讨厌
we're on the subject of really nasty
exam questions about six years ago there

311
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:58,870
这是一个考试问题，没有一个学生能正确完成， 
was an exam question about this that not
a single student got right and the

312
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:03,880
考官在这方面让您知道了疯子，而您对这可怕的事情感到愤慨
examiner went you know in berserk on
that and you've ranted about the awful

313
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,560
学生等等，但是嗯，但是你知道这就是你所需要的
students and so forth but uh but you
know it's just you know that's required

314
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:13,180
他们要做的，但实际上问题实际上是非常困难的
of them to do but it actually the
question was actually quite difficult

315
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:18,820
而且我认为这是我要向您解释问题的根源
and and I think it was I'm gonna explain
to you what the question was about it's

316
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,430
如果您以前没看过的话，很难
something that if you hadn't seen it
before it would be very very hard to

317
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,370
弄清楚，但我想期望是你应该
figure it out but I guess the
expectation was you were supposed to be

318
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,770
教过它，我认为没有人教过，所以现在我要教它
taught it and I don't think anyone
taught it so now I'm going to teach it

319
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,990
所以如果它出现了，你们都会知道的，所以问题就在于
so if it comes up you'll all know it so
the the question was about it's

320
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,200
比较像这样的东西和像硅的东西，所以这是
comparing something like this to
something like silicon so this is

321
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,730
硅看起来完全像碳化硅，唯一的区别是
silicon here it looks exactly like
silicon carbide the only difference is

322
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:43,120
而不是四分之一一季度一季度的碳
instead of carbon at one quarter one
quarter one quarter you

323
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,470
将这些碳与另一个硅放在一起，所以全都是硅硅零零
place those carbons with another silicon
so it's all silicon silicon zero zero

324
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,170
每季度四分之一的硅含量为零，我们已经看到了这一点
zero in silicon at one quarter one
quarter one quarter we've seen this

325
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,530
之前的结构这也是与钻石相同的结构
structure before too
this is the same structure as diamond

326
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:59,590
硅和金刚石结构等同于相同的晶体结构
silicon and diamond structure are
equivalent same same crystal structure

327
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:05,110
实际上，如果您在这里查看K的两个两个能量本征能谱
and actually if you look at the two two
energy eigen energy spectra here of K

328
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:08,470
从底部到顶部，它们实际上是硅和硅
across the bottom and energy up top
they're actually silicon and silicon

329
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,940
碳化物，它们看起来几乎不错，我不会说完全相同，但非常相似
carbide they look almost well I wouldn't
say identical but extremely similar a

330
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,590
一个中的许多功能都存在于另一个中，所以您知道
lot of the features in one are there in
the other as well you know so for

331
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:22,150
例如，在这里您具有相同的抛物线，但您会注意到只有一种
example here you have the same parabola
but you'll notice there's one one sort

332
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,679
令人震惊的区别是，青铜器自身的边界处没有缝隙
of shocking difference here that there's
no gap at at the bronze own boundary

333
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:32,110
在这个X点，在这里X点，抛物线聚在一起，它们
here at this X point the X points here
the parabolas come together and they

334
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,300
他们不，他们根本不分裂，所以应该推论的是
they don't they don't split at all and
so what one is supposed to deduce is in

335
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,600
 X点根本没有积雪散布的事实
fact that there's no snow back
scattering at the X point at all for

336
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:44,710
硅中的某些原因您不会在X点处散射
some reason in silicon you do not get
scattering at the X point okay

337
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:50,770
所以现在我们要设法弄清楚为什么如此首先
so it's so now we're gonna try to figure
out why that is so first of all for the

338
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:54,400
巧克力棒，X点的散射从一侧的X点开始
chocolate bar the scattering at the X
point goes from an X point on one side

339
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,670
拥有的青铜器的另一侧拥有什么是米勒
of the bronze own to the opposite side
of the bronze own what are the Miller

340
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:08,140
与该倒易的晶格矢量相关的索引
indices associated with that reciprocal
lattice vector what not no one no this

341
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,150
真的很好零零一个是一个很好的猜测，但是不正确
is really good zero zero one is a very
good guess but it's not right does

342
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:23,500
任何人都想要另一个猜测，不，不，所以零零一个是正确的方向
anyone want another guess no no no and
so zero zero one is the right direction

343
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,940
或者实际上我想它在X方向上，或者如果您愿意的话，它在一个零零
or actually I guess it's in in in the X
direction or one zero zero if you prefer

344
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,120
如果您在X方向上进行操作，那将是指向
if you're doing in the X direction it
would be if that would point be pointing

345
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,690
在正确的方向上，因为X在KX方向上，而负X将是
in the right direction because X is in
the K X direction and minus X would be

346
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,740
在相反的KX方向上，所以在1 0 0方向上
in the opposite KX direction so be in
the 1 0 0 direction that you're

347
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:44,260
散射或0 0 1（如果您采用其他方法），那么这是正确的
scattering or the 0 0 1 if you're going
the other way so that's the right

348
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:50,200
方向，但不是1 0 0，而不是1 0 0，是因为1 0 0 
direction but it's not 1 0 0 and the
reason it's not 1 0 0 is because 1 0 0

349
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,310
不是FCC晶格的倒数晶格矢量，您会记得回到
is not a reciprocal lattice vector for
FCC lattice and you'll remember back to

350
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,820
这幅画在这里，他们记得那个
this picture here they remember that
ones

351
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:00,330
如果您定义零，则是简单立方晶格的倒数晶格
zero is a reciprocal lattice for the
simple cubic lattice if you define the

352
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:05,279
一零零米勒指数的飞机，你会在这里得到这些飞机，但FCC 
planes by the one zero zero Miller index
you get these planes here but the FCC

353
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,909
格在中间有一些额外的格点，所以一个零零是
lattice has some additional lattice
points in the middle so one zero zero is

354
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,480
没有得到所有的最后点，因此它不是倒数晶格
does not get all the last points
therefore it is not a reciprocal lattice

355
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,980
 FCC晶格的矢量2零零是最小的倒易晶格
vector for the FCC lattice two zero zero
is the smallest reciprocal lattice

356
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,720
向量在那个方向上，所以这里是从X 2减去X的散射，我什至
vector in that direction so here is
scattering from X 2 minus X I'll even

357
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:31,500
写下来，对于硅阱，X 2减去X散射为2 0 0 
write that down so X 2 minus X
scattering is 2 0 0 for silicon well

358
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:36,570
实际上对于任何CC晶格X 2减去X都是2 0 0好的，所以我们得到了
actually for anything CC lattice X 2
minus X is 2 0 0 ok so we've gotten that

359
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:43,320
到目前为止，问题是为什么为什么在2 0 0处没有散射
far now the question is why is it that
we don't get any scattering at 2 0 0

360
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,080
 Miller指数有没有人想过我还剩下这些呢？ 
Miller index does anyone want to guess
of that I have one more of these left

361
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:58,529
好吧，我听不见谁是Matt的，是的， 
well is it
I can't hear who the the Matt's yeah and

362
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:02,750
虽然它们都是硅，是的，所以那不是对你没有帮助
while they both silicon's so yeah so so
that doesn't that doesn't do it for you

363
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:16,620
其他任何FCC晶格都是具有基础的FCC晶格，所以我不会
any other it is FCC lattice is an FCC
lattice with a basis so I'm not gonna

364
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:19,379
为此给你，但它已经接近那个，所以也许我会给你
give you give it to you for that but
it's close to that so maybe I'd give you

365
00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:24,240
它的一半，但我不知道该怎么做，所以它不是纯粹的，不只是
a half of this but I don't know how to
do it so so it's not pure it's not just

366
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,720
 FCC晶格，这就是必须跟踪
an FCC lattice and that's the point that
it's you have to keep track of the

367
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,200
在基础中找出是否有散射，所以让我们考虑
lattice in the basis to find out if
there's there scattering so let's think

368
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,720
回到我的意思是FCC晶格，但如果硅是
back to I mean is an FCC lattice but it
allows the silicon if the silicon is a

369
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,159
基于八次的点阵加法，所以如果我们考虑我们学到的东西
lattice plus of eight times a basis so
if we think about what we learned about

370
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:48,149
来自x射线散射的散射记住s是s晶格乘以s 
scattering from from x-ray scattering
remember that s is s lattice times s

371
00:32:48,149 --> 00:32:54,750
基本权，S是给您散射权的幅度，如果我们
basis right and the S is what gives you
the amplitude of scattering right if we

372
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:57,870
方屁股，您得到的散射幅度适用于X射线，它
square ass you get the amplitude of
scattering this worked for x-rays and it

373
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,399
也会对电子起作用，因此强制选择规则的晶格
will work for electrons as well so s
lattice that enforces selection rules

374
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,470
执行选择规则
enforce selection rules

375
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:14,500
并且0-0实际上满足了FCC晶格的选择规则
and to 0-0 actually satisfies the
selection rule for an FCC lattice all

376
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,299
对于FCC来说，偶数都是奇数，两个零零都是偶数，所以我们可以接受
even are all odd for FCC two zero zero
is all even so we're okay with that so

377
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:24,760
那不会消失，但是让我们看一下基础
that's not gonna that's not gonna vanish
but let's look at s basis that's basis

378
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:35,230
您会记得是e的单位格中的Adams alpha与F sub alpha的总和。 
you'll recall is sum over Adams alpha in
unit cell of e to the F sub alpha the

379
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:44,350
形状因子e到i gr alpha，如果我们对硅这样做，它将得到F 
form factor e to the i gr alpha and if
we do this for silicon will get F

380
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:49,330
硅，然后在零零零处将为1，然后我们将
silicon and then it'll be one for the
point at zero zero zero and then we'll

381
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:54,520
将e设为2 pi，然后将散射的米勒指数设为零零
get e to the 2 pi and then the Miller
indices of the scattering to zero zero

382
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:02,020
乘以晶格点的位置四分之一，四分之一，四分之一
times the position of the lattice point
one quarter one quarter one quarter like

383
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,929
从我们的X射线散射历险中看起来很熟悉吗
that does this look familiar from our
x-ray scattering adventures yeah ok so

384
00:34:06,929 --> 00:34:15,879
您会注意到这里的东西实际上是负1，所以s为零
you'll notice that this thing here is
actually minus 1 so s basis is zero so

385
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:21,940
在硅上没有2 0 0方向的反向散射，因为有
there's no back scattering in silicon in
the 2 0 0 direction because there's you

386
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:26,350
知道我会给我的，我还是会给你的，因为哎呀，因为我不想
know I'll give it I'll give this to you
anyway because oops because I don't want

387
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:31,449
自己保留它，因为我会吃它，而且我的体重一直在增加，所以还可以
to keep it myself because I'll eat it
and I've been gaining weight so ok so so

388
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:35,529
这样您就不会在2 0 0中返回散射，但是通过

389
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:39,730
或0，因为这是告诉您的是
the or 0 because there's it's a what
this is telling you is that there's

390
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,918
两种硅的散射之间的确切破坏性干涉
exact destructive interference between
the scattering of the two silicon's in

391
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,489
它们都会散布的晶胞，但随后您将遭受破坏
the unit cell they'll both scatter but
then you get exact destructive

392
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:52,178
受它们的干扰，因此实际上，在

393
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:57,730
天，这个物理原理实际上是您知道它在X射线中弯曲
day and this this physics is actually
it's you know it curves for x-rays in

394
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,320
硅在2 0 0方向上没有硅的X射线散射
silicon there's no scattering of x-rays
for silicon in the 2 0 0 direction it

395
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,010
电子的曲线没有电子X点的反向散射
curves for electrons there's no back
scattering of the X point for electrons

396
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:10,270
在硅中，声子也会发生。让我们看一下这是
in silicon it also occurs for phonons
let's see here's the phonon spectrum for

397
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,840
硅，看起来很像钻石的声子光谱，但不是
silicon this looks a whole lot like the
phonon spectrum for diamond but not

398
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,180
巧合的是，因为它是相同的晶体结构，所以这里是硅
coincidentally because it's the same
crystal structure so here's the silicon

399
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,510
来自它的声子，所以我们去了
phonons
from it has so we went we had this uh

400
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:28,930
以前每个K向量有六个声子，因为每个K矢量
previously there's six phonons at every
K vector because there are two atoms per

401
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,050
基本单位单元，每个单元都向三个方向移动，所以有六个
primitive unit cell and each one moves
in three directions so there's six

402
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:36,520
光子一二三四五六六
photons one two three four five six and
A three of them are acoustic coming down

403
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,690
现在，您会注意到，如果您在此处的X点处查看此点
here now you'll notice if you look at
this point here at the X point in this

404
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:45,460
图片碳化硅有一个缝隙在此图片中没有缝隙
picture silicon carbide a gap has opened
up in this picture a gap has not opened

405
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:49,330
甚至来自声子波
up and it's coming from essentially the
same physics even with phonon waves that

406
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:52,420
在两个零零方向上没有反向散射，因此您不会
in the two zero zero direction there's
not back scattering therefore you don't

407
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,690
有一个缝隙的开口，而在碳化硅II中则没有
have an opening of a gap whereas in
silicon carbide II you don't have

408
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,500
完美的取消，因为这个词将有F硅这个词会
perfect cancellation because this term
would have F silicon this term would

409
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:03,099
碳彼此不相等的碳，所以你仍然会回来
have F carbon those don't equal each
other so you would still have back

410
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,420
分散，您在Barone自己的边界上会留出空隙，好吧，我
scattering and you have a gap opening up
at the Barone's own boundary okay so I

411
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,040
意识到这是一个您知道有点复杂的问题，但是
realized this is this is a you know a
little bit complicated but it was on an

412
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,980
考试，希望您知道如果再次参加考试，人们将能够
exam and hopefully you know if it comes
up on an exam again people will be able

413
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,920
使它正确，但我确实承认，如果您之前从未见过
to get it right but but I do admit that
if you've never seen that before

414
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,680
这很难弄清楚，所以好吧
it's something that's pretty hard to
figure out so all right so having

415
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,200
基本讨论了我们需要了解的几乎所有免费内容
basically discussed everything that we
need to know about the nearly free

416
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,410
电子模型，我们现在可以继续讨论带理论带
electron model we can now move on to
talking about generally band theory band

417
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:42,520
电子的结构带理论，所以这些复杂的图片在这里
structure band theory of electrons so
these complicated pictures here they're

418
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,730
碳化硅再次具有其所有本征的复杂图景
silicon carbide again with it's
complicated picture of all its eigen

419
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:52,030
停留在每一个K中，所以让我们开始谈论UH 
stays in every every K so let's um we
started talking about about the UH

420
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,750
理论，当我们谈论紧密绑定模型时，也许我们来画一幅画
theory when we talked about the tight
binding model maybe let's draw a picture

421
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,810
一些乐队在这里，所以这里是能量
of some bands like over here so here is
energy

422
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,640
这是这个方向上的K，所以我会自己画青铜
here's K in this direction so I'll draw
the bronze own there's a bronze own from

423
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:08,589
减去两个PI上的PI，然后您可能会有一些像
minus PI over a two PI over a and then
you might have some band that look like

424
00:37:08,589 --> 00:37:11,530
然后是一个更高的波段，看起来像这样，也许还有更高的波段
this and then a higher band that looks
like this and maybe some higher bands up

425
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:16,810
现在在这里，还有我们提到的一些事情
here as well
now some things that we mentioned when

426
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:21,490
我们讨论的紧密绑定模型是，如果您有一个填充带
we talked about the tight binding model
is that if you have a filled band filled

427
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:29,500
带和间隙加上间隙，您得到的绝缘子等于绝缘子重复
band and a gap plus gap you have an
insulator equals insulator repeating

428
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:33,530
这是因为它非常重要，所以如果我们填充乐队，我们会说
this because it's fairly important so if
we fill a band we fill say

429
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:40,160
这个带和下一个带的间隙，我们有一个绝缘体，原因是
this band and a gap to the next band we
have an insulator and the reason this is

430
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,850
绝缘子是因为基本上没有放置位置的自由
an insulator is because there's
basically no freedom of where to put

431
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:47,840
您的电子，除非您克服了下一个能带之间的间隙
your electrons unless you overcome the
gap to the next to the next band which

432
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,260
上升到下一个频段可能需要很多能量
could be a lot of a lot of energy
required to get up to the next band you

433
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,820
根本无法重新排列电子，它们无法吸收任何无法吸收的热量
can't rearrange the electrons at all
they can't absorb any heat they can't

434
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:58,700
进行更改，他们无法更改其动量，因为所有动量状态
run change they can't change their
momentum because all the momentum states

435
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,270
已经充满了，所以基本上基本上是惰性的，所以我写
are already filled so it's basically
just completely inert so I'll write that

436
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:06,800
向下是惰性的，如果您有两个频段又被完全填充
down it's inert and if you have two
bands that are completely filled again

437
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,080
您将在下一个频段使用一个应用程序，它也将成为绝缘体
you'll have an app to the next band it
will also be an insulator a little bit

438
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,260
 Naumann clay Chur有用的是填充最高的乐队
of Naumann clay Chur which is useful is
the highest filled band highest filled

439
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:30,200
带通常被称为价带价带，所以在这里这将是一个
band is usually called the valence band
valence band so here this would be a

440
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:45,200
价带和最低空下最低空人称为
valence band and the lowest empty down
lowest empty man is known as the

441
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:54,140
导带对于摇滚乐队来说也是个好名字
conduction band which would also be a
really good name for a rock group so if

442
00:38:54,140 --> 00:39:03,050
任何人都可以组成一个摇滚乐队，我建议一个命名的乐队
anyone makes a rock group I'm suggesting
a named conduction band okay

443
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:12,500
所以另一个重要的陈述是，绝缘体的间隙很小
so another important statement that
insulator with small gap with a small

444
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:19,520
间隙间隙被称为半导体，此处的间隙小于4 
gap gap is known as a semi conductor and
small here is sort of less than about 4

445
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,660
电子伏特等于它被称为半导体
electron volts equals this is known as a
semi conductor

446
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:32,850
而这种命名的原因是，如果间隙足够小
and the reason for this nomenclature is
that if the gap is sufficiently small

447
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:37,200
那么在零温度下这仍然是一个非常好的绝缘体，但是在
then at zero temperature this would
still be a really good insulator but at

448
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,060
如果间隙小于约四个电子伏特，则为室温300开尔文
room temperature 300 Kelvin if the gap
is less than about four electron volts

449
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,470
那么一些电子仍然可以从填充的电子中获得热激发
then a few electrons will still be able
to get thermally excited from the filled

450
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:49,800
带进入空带，所以您将有几个电子自由运行
band into the empty band so you'll have
a couple electrons running around free

451
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,990
只是热占据了导带，它们将携带一定量的
just thermally occupying the conduction
band and they will carry some amount of

452
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,080
当前你会得到一些电子在这里跑来跑去
current that you'll you'll get a couple
of electrons running around up here and

453
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,400
这将使他们能够携带少量的电流
that will allow them to carry some small
amount of current some small amount of

454
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,440
导电性，所以它是一种半导体，导电性很差，但是
conductivity so it's a semi conductor
conduct sort of semi conducts poorly but

455
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,240
它的行为类似，可以吸收少量热量，但不会吸收大量热量
it conducts similarly it can absorb a
small amounts of heat but not a lot of

456
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,860
因为只有极少数的电子可以重新排列，所以这很有意义
heat because only a very few electrons
can be rearranged okay that makes sense

457
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:25,140
是的，所以实际上这张碳化硅图片
yeah okay so actually so this picture of
silicon carbide silicon carbide these

458
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,000
这里所有的谱带都充满了费米能量，或者化学势位于
bands here all filled the Fermi energy
or the chemical potential lies in the

459
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,380
间隙的中间，所以您可以说它是绝缘体或半导体， 
middle of this gap so you would say that
it's an insulator or semiconductor and

460
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,890
如果您看一下这点之间的能量差，最低
if you sort of look at the difference in
energy between this point the lowest

461
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:41,520
导带的点，这里是最高带
point of the conduction band and this
point here which is the highest band

462
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,480
指向价带，它小于40 V，所以我们说
point to the valence band
it's a little less than 40 V so we say

463
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,330
碳化硅是一种半导体，好吧，我们还提到了其他一些东西
silicon carbide is a semiconductor okay
there's something else that we mentioned

464
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:58,140
当我们谈论紧密结合模型时，电子在计数
when we talked about tight binding model
is that counting electrons is counting

465
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,070
电子和状态对于弄清楚是否存在
electrons and States is rather important
to figuring out if you have a filled

466
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:11,850
波段或不波段，如果您的系统中有n个单位单元，则您有n个K状态K 
band or not if you have n unit cells in
your system then you have n K States K

467
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:22,040
状态，但此时您有两个自旋状态，每K自旋状态就可以了， 
States but then you have times two spin
States spin States per K okay means that

468
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:32,520
两个n电子将填充一个能带，将填充能带，得到2 n个电子
two n electrons will fill a band will
fill band and this to get 2 n electrons

469
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,790
每个晶胞需要两个电子
you need two electrons per unit cell

470
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:44,670
因此，您期望如果您有任何偶数个偶数个电子
so that you expect that if you have any
any even number even number of electrons

471
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:53,400
每晶胞本身的电子数，您会期望
per unit cell number of electrons per
unit cell itself you would expect that

472
00:41:53,400 --> 00:42:06,210
您可以填充可以填充整数的带数整数带的数，所以让我们
you can fill can fill integer number of
bands integer number of bands so let's

473
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:11,910
以碳化硅为例，所以碳化硅
take the case of silicon carbide for
example so silicon carbide silicon

474
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:21,690
碳化物，所以碳化硅的化合价都是四价
carbide so silicon carbide both valence
four so silicon and carbon both valence

475
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:31,200
形成两个化合价等于四，这意味着我们应该算
form both valence for valence equals
four which means we should count for

476
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:36,059
如果每个电子都可以，那么为什么我要
electrons for each of them okay if you
wanted to count all of the so why am I

477
00:42:36,059 --> 00:42:39,869
只计四个而不是全部电子，原因是
only counting four instead of all of
their electrons the reason is because

478
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:43,710
这只是我们实际上通常只计算最外层外壳中的电子
it's only we really generally only count
the electrons in the farthest out shell

479
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,670
因为任何更远的贝壳都是完全惰性的，它们只是称重而已
because any of the farther in shells are
completely inert they just weigh buried

480
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,490
能量要低得多，但是如果您想算一下，它们的弹壳就是
had much much lower energies but if you
wanted to count they're filled shells as

481
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:58,410
好吧，您会发现它们充满了弹壳，所以也是如此
well you would discover that they're
filled shells are all even as well so so

482
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,609
对于硅和碳，我们仍然会有偶数个电子
we would still have an even number of
electrons both for silicon and carbon so

483
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:08,369
图中的原始晶胞这里的乳脂晶胞有四个
the primitive unit cell here cream unit
cell in this picture it has four

484
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:15,569
电子四对八电子共一硅原子一碳
electrons four sorry eight electrons
total total one silicon atom one carbon

485
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:24,170
每个载有四个电子的原子，所以我们应该填充四个能带I 
atom each carrying four electrons so we
should fill four bands four bands I

486
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:30,000
想想我在一周左右或更早之前就钻石问了同样的问题
think I asked the same question about
diamond about a week ago or more and in

487
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,760
事实上，如果您计算的是费米能量以下的波段数
fact if you count the number of bands
here which are below the Fermi energy

488
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,319
一共有四一二三四，他们都满了，我们确实有
there are four of them one two three
four and they're all filled we do have

489
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:40,980
这里有些混乱，如果您在这里数，它看起来像
this little bit of a confusion here that
if you count here it would look like

490
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,849
只有三个，但是如果仔细看，您会注意到这两个向量
there's only three but if you look more
carefully you'll notice this vectors two

491
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:47,700
这里的乐队聚集在一起并具有相同的能量，所以这个实际上是
bands here which come together and have
the same energy so this one is actually

492
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,720
刚好有两个乐队
two bands it just happened to have the
same

493
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,660
在这里他们有不同的能量，所以你可以算出实际上有四个
here they have different energies so you
can count that there's actually four of

494
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:56,320
他们，所以在碳化硅中所有这四个带被填充，所有这些
them so in silicon carbide all these
four bands are filled and all these

495
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:04,270
这里的乐队是空的好好是是好好好现在在
bands up here are empty good good yes
yes okay good all right now in in

496
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:16,630
相比之下，我们的金属有部分填充带，部分填充带几乎
contrast we have metals have part filled
bands part filled bands which is almost

497
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:22,150
永远都是正确的，我可能会写得大多是真实的
always true
mostly I may write mostly true either

498
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:26,050
今天或下一次，我们将讨论为什么大多数情况下都是正确的。 
today or next time we'll discuss about
why it's only mostly true mostly true

499
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:34,960
对于奇数个电子，为奇数个，每晶胞为
for odd for odd number of electrons odd
number electrons per unit cell for

500
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,860
例如，如果我们有这样的照片，那么这是青铜器，这是乐队
example if we had a picture like this so
here's the bronze own here's a band

501
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,890
这是一个带，假设每个单位电池有一个电子
here's a band suppose we have one
electron per unit cell if that would be

502
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:50,020
足以填满最低频段的一半，所以我们充满了一颗心
enough to half fill the lowest band and
so we have a heart filled down this is

503
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:56,350
每个单位电池部分填充一个电子，这里我们将其称为
one electron per unit cell part filled
band here and we would call this thing a

504
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:00,400
金属，因为带子只有部分填充，所以我们可以降低能量
metal because since the band is only
part filled we can make low energy

505
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,060
通过从填充点到未填充点带走电子来激发
excitations by taking electron from the
filled point to the unfilled point

506
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,340
任意低的能量我们也可以改变这些充满的动力
arbitrarily low energy we can also
change the momentum of these filled

507
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,640
通过仅从此处获取一些电子并移动它们来实现状态
States by just taking some of the
electrons from over here and moving them

508
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,260
以非常低的能源成本在这里转移整个
over here at very low energy costs are
just slightly shifting the entire the

509
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:20,830
整个图片稍微向右移动以填充更多状态
entire picture slightly shifting it to
the right to fill a couple more states

510
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,640
在这里，这里的州少一些，因为您正在更改
over here and a few less fewer States
over here and since you're changing the

511
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,240
在这种情况下，您实际上是在增加电流，因此通过改变
momentum you're actually adding current
in that case so by changing momentum of

512
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,810
所有这些电子实际上已经改变了总电流
all these electrons you've actually
changed the total electrical current in

513
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:36,030
该系统，因此由于它可以承载电流，我们称其为金属
that system and so since it can carry
current we call it a metal

514
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:45,130
但是金属也可能发生金属也以偶数发生
however metals can also occur metals
also occur also occur with even number

515
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:53,830
每个单元电池的电子数量是偶数
with even number of electrons per unit
cell also something I mentioned a couple

516
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:57,760
几周前，当我们讨论紧密绑定模型时，发生的方式是
weeks ago when we discussed tight
binding model the way that happens is

517
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,120
如果您的最低乐队看起来像这样，这是您的青铜乐队
here's your bronze own if you have a
lowest band that looks kind of like this

518
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,420
然后你有一个更高的频段像这样下降
and then you have a higher band that
dips down like this

519
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:10,090
你和你曾经说过，每个晶胞有两个电子就足够了
you and you had say two electrons per
unit cell that would be just enough

520
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:14,890
电子填充一个带，但你我的意思是你可以选择填充一个
electrons to fill one band but you I
mean you could choose to fill this

521
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:18,310
整个频段，如果您想要整个最低频段，那将是
entire band if you wanted to this entire
lowest band but that would be

522
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,750
与部分填充两个频段相比，在能量上不利
energetically unfavorable compared to
partially filling both of the bands so

523
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:27,940
相反，最好是部分填充并部分填充而不是
instead it's better to partially fill
this and partially fill this instead of

524
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,190
在较低的频带中填充这些较高的能量状态确实有意义
filling these higher energy states in in
this lower band does that make sense yes

525
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,980
是的，好的，所以在这种情况下，频段重叠，如果频段重叠
yes okay good so so in this case it
bands overlap I'll write this if bands

526
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:47,530
重叠重叠，看起来有点像，当我画画时您知道不自然
overlap overlap and it looks on it looks
a little you know unnatural when I draw

527
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:51,670
这样，但是如果您回头看一下碳化硅带
it this way but if you would look back
to the to the silicon carbide band

528
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,869
在这里的结构，您当然可以想象到您的脑袋
structure here you could certainly
imagine your head that this minimum just

529
00:46:55,869 --> 00:47:00,070
进一步下降一点，这个最大值上升了一点
dipped down a little bit further and
this maximum came up just a little bit

530
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,330
更进一步，如果那是真的，那么这个最小值就低于这个费米
further and if that were true so that
this minimum went below this Fermi

531
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:08,170
能量，它超过了费米能量，然后是一些电子
energy and this went above the Fermi
energy then some of the electrons that

532
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:12,369
以前在这个乐队中被填补，然后进入这个乐队
was previously in this band that was
filled would then go into this band

533
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:18,430
它是空的，可以降低能量，所以一件事，我们真的
which was empty to lower the energy okay
so one thing that we that's really

534
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:22,750
跟踪频段之间的差距有多重要，因此如果
important to keep track of is how big
are the gaps between bands so if the

535
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:25,869
乐队之间的差距真的很大，那么您将不会有这个
gaps between the bands are really huge
then you're not going to have this

536
00:47:25,869 --> 00:47:30,700
曾经发生过这种情况，您知道波段之间的距离足够远
situation ever occur you know that the
bands are sufficiently far apart then

537
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:37,030
他们不会重叠，所以我们的差距有多大我们的差距有多大
they're not going to overlap so how big
our gaps how big our gaps big our gaps

538
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:42,660
乐队之间的差距
between bands gaps between bands

539
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:53,080
问题很好，我们用不同的方式来描述我们如何理解乐队
question well we had different ways of
describing how we understand the band

540
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:57,550
结构描述它的一种方式是从紧密结合中的紧密结合
structure one way of describing it was
from tight binding in the tight binding

541
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:04,510
我们称它为一个带每个带每个带来自一个原子轨道的图片
picture we called it a band each band
each band comes from an atomic orbital

542
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:16,859
来自能量为e的原子轨道原子轨道
is from an atomic orbital
atomicorbital with energy of energy e

543
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:32,430
能量称为子I，带宽是从跳变到弹出
with energy it's called a sub I and the
bandwidth is from hopping from popping a

544
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:42,430
 PT，因此如果原始原子轨道彼此之间的间隔很好
PT so if the original atomic orbitals
are very well spaced apart from each

545
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,819
其他，跳动很小，那么乐队没有机会重叠
other and the hopping is small then the
bands don't have a chance to overlap

546
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:49,359
因为最初彼此之间的距离很远，所以跳动是
because initially start very far apart
from each other and the hopping is what

547
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,529
将频带从单一能量扩展到频带，因此如果跳跃是
spreads the band out from a single
energy into a band so if the hopping is

548
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:56,980
小，能量间隔大，那么谱带不会重叠，所以
small and the energy spacing is large
then the bands won't overlap so that's

549
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,170
一种理解它的方式，这是理解它为何的一种自然方式
one way of understanding it that's sort
of a natural way to understand why it is

550
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:06,160
当它们形成晶体时，有一种稀有气体
that there's something like noble gases
when they form crystals there are

551
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,690
绝缘子，因为稀有气体之间的跳变基本上为零，所以这些
insulators because the hopping between
noble gases is essentially zero so these

552
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:15,970
原子轨道之间的间隔很小，但两者之间的跳跃传播
atomic orbitals they're spaced a little
bit but the hopping between that spreads

553
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:20,200
将这些轨道带入带区可以忽略不计，因此它们不会形成很宽的范围
out these orbitals into bands is
negligible so they don't form very wide

554
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,230
乐队，所以乐队永远不会重叠，所以这是理解它的一种方式
bands and so the bands never overlap so
um so that's one way of understanding it

555
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,750
但在几乎免费的模型中，几乎免费
but in a nearly free model nearly free

556
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:41,589
布里渊区边界与BZ边界之间的间隙来自
the gaps at the Brillouin zone boundary
ad BZ boundary are from from the

557
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:49,509
 X的电位V的周期电位，所以如果您知道
periodic potential from potential V of X
so if you know that the periodic

558
00:49:49,509 --> 00:49:53,109
潜力巨大，您应该期待两个巨大的鸿沟
potential is strong you should expect
two gaps that are pretty big opening up

559
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:57,849
在青铜的边界处，而如果电势相当弱，那么您
at the bronze own boundary whereas if
the potential is fairly weak then you

560
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:04,500
我希望可能不会在俯卧带边界上有很大的差距
expect not to have big gaps in the prone
zone boundary all right I think maybe

561
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:07,539
虽然我们还有两分钟，但我想也许我们应该停在那里
although we have two minutes left I
think maybe we should stop there and

562
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:12,390
明天我们将进一步讨论乐队理论
we'll pick up more on band theory
tomorrow

563
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,450
