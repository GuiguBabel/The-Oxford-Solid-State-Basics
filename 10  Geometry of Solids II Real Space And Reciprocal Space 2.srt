1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:04,810
这是我们离开时的浓缩课程第十讲
this is now the tenth lecture of the
condensed matter course when we left off

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,700
上一次我们谈论三维的晶格时，我们已经介绍了
last time we were talking about lattices
in three dimensions we've covered the

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,659
简单的立方晶格或原始立方晶格，我们已经移至主体
simple cubic lattice or primitive cubic
lattice and we've moved on to the body

4
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:26,470
居中居中立方居中立方晶格或BCC或立方- 
centered body centered cubic body
centered cubic lattice or BCC or cubic -

5
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:32,320
我和我们有一张图片，显示了以身体为中心的常规晶胞
I and we have a picture of that the
conventional unit cell the body centered

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,929
立方晶格看起来像这样，在所有
cubic lattice looks something like this
there's a 1-point shared among all the

7
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:42,089
八个角，八个八分之一，然后在中心
eight corners one eighth times eight of
them and then one in the center of the

8
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:45,729
常规单元在常规单元中产生两个晶格点
conventional unit cell making two
lattice points in the conventional unit

9
00:00:45,729 --> 00:00:50,530
单元格，您可以从上方查看事物，在此平面图方案中， 
cell you can look at the thing from
above and in this plan view scheme where

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,089
您可以适当地标记所有高度，因此这里
you label all of the heights
appropriately so this point here

11
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,030
在此对应于此点，并说未标记的点在高度0处， 
corresponds to this point here and says
unlabeled points are at height zero and

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:04,150
因此，如果您实际放置原子，则此点的高度为零，高度为a 
a so this point is at height zero and
height a now if you actually put atoms

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,690
在以身体为中心的立方晶格的晶格点上，您注意到
at the lattice points of the body
centered cubic lattice you notice that

14
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:12,460
您非常有效地包装了球体，填补了您的空缺
you packed the spheres fairly
efficiently you filled the hole that you

15
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,670
如果只是一个简单的立方晶格就会有，因此
would have had if it was just a simple
cubic lattice and because of that this

16
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,950
是原子许多元素的更普遍的安排锂钠
is a much more common arrangement for
atoms lots of elements sodium lithium

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,370
铁钾都具有体心立方晶格构型
iron potassium all take body centered
cubic lattice configurations it's

18
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:30,820
从这张照片可以明显看出，协调数
obvious from this picture that the
coordination number the number of

19
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,570
如果您考虑它中心的球体，则最近的邻居是8 
nearest neighbors is eight if you think
about the sphere in the center it has

20
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:38,340
显然，顶部有四个邻居，底部有四个邻居，总共
obviously four neighbors on top and four
neighbors on bottom making a total

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,900
协调数8对您来说可能并不明显
coordination number of 8 it may not be
obvious to you that every point in this

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,540
晶格彼此相等，这是我们对a的定义之一
lattice is equivalent to each other
that's one of our definitions of a

23
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,070
每个晶格点都应具有相同的环境，所以我们将
lattice that every lattice point should
have the same environment but so we'll

24
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,840
很好地看这张照片，这显然是这个领域
look at this picture here well most is
this this sphere here is obviously in

25
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,520
黄色轮廓立方体的中心，但是如果我们取其中之一的黄色
the center of the yellow outline cube
but if we take one of the yellow of one

26
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,300
黄色轮廓立方体的四角之一，它也位于
of the corners of the yellow outline
cube like that one it is also in the

27
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:11,050
另一个立方体的中心，所以每个球体都认为它们在一个立方体内
center of another cube so each sphere
thinks that they are inside a cube so

28
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:15,460
每个球体的每个点都是等价的，可能不是
every sphere every point of the lattice
is equivalent that may not be a

29
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,170
有说服力的论点足以说服您BCC实际上是
sufficiently convincing argument to
convince you that the BCC is actually a

30
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:27,610
所以我们应该做的是写下我的晶格向量
lattice so what we should do is we
should write down the lattice vectors my

31
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:37,840
检查员将使用以下内容编写为uvwxa晶格常数a 
inspectors which will write as u v w x a
lattice constant a with the following

32
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:58,209
可能性可能性1要么与可能性要么呆在一起1全部
possibilities possibility 1 either stay
with either possibility 1 all business

33
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:04,600
声音消失了，你能说出某事消失了吗
out and the sound is falling out
can you name something something's gone

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:11,230
错误可以召唤回去修理，如果我使用其他麦克风或
wrong can can summon back there fixing
it should I use the other microphone or

35
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:21,610
我应该看看好吗，也许我们会杀死声音，然后
should I just see good yeah man maybe
maybe we kill the sound and then and

36
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:28,030
我只想大声一点，那就是有人可以回到那里更好，是的，所以我不是说
I'll just yell is that better
can someone back there yeah so no I mean

37
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,390
应该有一个人回到那里，那里没有人回到我那里
there should be someone back there who's
there's not someone back there I have no

38
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,120
想法就是这个关键，只要继续前进，看看我们是否可以忍受它
idea it's just this key just keep going
and see if we can suffer through it for

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,410
一会儿有人会打赌那个人的赌注又回来了
a while someone would that's the
person's bet is back there is fixing it

40
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:47,200
好吧，希望这将得到解决，如果仍然无法解决，请阻止我
ok so hopefully this will get fixed stop
me if it doesn't okay anyway you can

41
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,310
阅读如果您听不到声音，您仍然可以阅读，所以我们要写
read you can still read if you can't
hear so we're gonna we're gonna write

42
00:03:51,310 --> 00:04:01,260
向下将晶格矢量作为UV W乘以a，并包含所有UV W整数和
down the lattice vectors as UV W times a
with either all of the UV W integers and

43
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:06,730
如果您以常规方式查看此整数，则对应的很好
the integer case corresponds to well if
you look in this in the conventional

44
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,470
晶胞是晶胞的角，因此该晶胞具有坐标1 0 0 
unit cell it's the corners of the unit
cell so this one has coordinate 1 0 0

45
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:18,970
这个有1 1 0等等，以此类推，另一个可能是UV和W uv 
this one has 1 1 0 and so forth and so
on the other possibility is UV and W u v

46
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:30,720
 w所有半个奇数整数1/2个奇数整数和一半的奇数我的意思是一半
w all half odd integers 1/2 odd integers
integers and by half odd I mean one half

47
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,660
三个一半五个一半，依此类推，这对应于最平坦的
three half five halves and so forth and
that corresponds to the the the flattest

48
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,070
点在立方体的中心，例如，此点将具有
points in the center of the cube for
example this point here would have

49
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:45,030
协调一半一半一半一半，所以这一半将是一半一半
coordinates one half one half one half
so this one would be one half one half

50
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,300
一半，这个一半是一半，一半是一半，依此类推， 
one half this one would be one half
three halves one half and so forth and

51
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,720
所以现在我们应该检查一下以使我们的
so on now
we should check to make one of our

52
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,010
或我们应该能够添加的晶格矢量的定义
definitions of lattice vectors of a
lattice or that we should be able to add

53
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,130
任何两个晶格矢量在一起，并获得另一个晶格矢量，它应该是
any two lattice vectors together and get
another lattice vector it should be a

54
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,850
加法下的封闭集，因此我们应该检查是否将整数添加到
closed set under addition so we should
check well if we add integers to

55
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,419
整数，我们回到整数，所以如果我们添加具有
integers we get back to integers so
that's good if we add integers that have

56
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:10,410
奇整数我们将整数取一半，所以如果再加上一半就很好
odd integers we get back half on
integers so that's good if we add half

57
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:14,310
在整数上，在一半上，我们返回整数，所以它可以工作
on integers and half on integers we get
back integers so it's gonna work either

58
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,729
方式彼此添加您会得到一些回馈
way add any of these to each other
you'll get back something it's either

59
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,830
这样的，这样就很好，使它成为格子
this kind of this kind so that's that's
good so that makes this a lattice so

60
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,520
让我们看看这里我们去那里我们去写下原始图很有用
let's see here we go there we go it's
it's useful to write down the primitive

61
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,430
这个晶格的晶格因子tlvs 
lattice factors tlvs
for this lattice which we can take to be

62
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:44,729
一零零乘以一零一零乘以一，然后再二分之一
one zero zero times a zero one zero
times a and then one half one half one

63
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:51,510
半数，所以让我们在这里看到这个图，所以它是一个零零
half times a so let's see that on this
on this plot here so it's one zero zero

64
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,860
乘以一零一零乘以a和二分之一乘以a的一半
times a zero one zero times a and one
half one half one half times a and to

65
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,830
让自己相信这些东西是原始的晶格向量，我们要做的就是
convince yourself that these things are
primitive lattice vectors all we have to

66
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,610
要做的就是说服自己，您可以通过以下方式到达晶格的任何点
do is convince ourselves that you can
get to any point of the lattice by

67
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,330
将它们以整数组合加在一起，例如，如果我想
adding these together in integer
combinations so for example if I wanted

68
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,010
为了达到这一点，我会把这个家伙一两次，然后减去
to get to this point here I would take
this guy twice one two and then subtract

69
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,860
这个，那将带我从这里到这里，我会到达这个格子
this one and that would take me from
here to here and I'd get to this lattice

70
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,250
点，您可以通过将这些内容加在一起
point and you can sort of work out that
that by adding these together and all

71
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,930
最终可以到达每个晶格点的整数组合
integer combinations you can get
eventually to every every lattice point

72
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:28,500
到目前为止，一切都很好，现在没有警告，这是一个
good so far so good
all right now no warning and it's it's a

73
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,010
警告世界上每个人都应该采取的行动不要犯以下错误
warning that that everyone in the world
should take do not make the mistake of

74
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,870
称氯化铯为体心立方晶格，晶格规则为
calling caesium chloride a body-centered
cubic lattice the rule of a lattice is

75
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,110
每个晶格点应该看起来相同，所以有
that every lattice point should look
identical so there is

76
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,110
这是身体中间的一个点，但与另一个不同
a point in the middle of the body here
but it's not identical to the other

77
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,680
点，所以它不是以人体为中心的立方晶格，而是具有
point so it's not a body centered cubic
lattice it's a simple cubic lattice with

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,120
一个基数，并且基数必须等于0 0 0处的等价原子1 
a basis and the basis has to in
equivalent atoms one at 0 0 0 which is

79
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,420
铯和另一个在1/2 1/2和1/2这是氯，有一个
cesium and the other is at 1/2 1/2 and
1/2 which is chlorine there's a

80
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,630
差异，所以它不是以身体为中心的立方晶格，您会发现
difference so it's not body centered
cubic lattice you will find books that

81
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,080
犯这个错误，这超出了名义艾希尔的不同， 
make this mistake this goes beyond
difference in nominal Eicher it's just

82
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,620
错误，称其为体心立方晶格纯铯是不正确的
wrong it is incorrect to call it body
centered cubic lattice cesium pure

83
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,490
铯，这里所有点上都有一个铯原子，甚至是
cesium where there is a cesium atom at
all the points here even the one in the

84
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,160
中心是一个以身体为中心的立方晶格，但是欢迎您称它为中心
center that is a body centered cubic
lattice but you're welcome to call it

85
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,780
您也可以称其为“体心立方” 
you're also allowed to call it body
centered cubic is the same thing as

86
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:27,150
具有基础的简单三次方，其中基础是我们所讨论的基础
simple cubic with a basis with basis
where the basis that we're talking about

87
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:36,360
这里包括一个0 0 0点和一个1/2 1/2 1/2点，它们是
here includes a point at 0 0 0 and a
point at 1/2 1/2 1/2 those are

88
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,190
等价的陈述，我想这个陈述的简单点是
equivalent statements I suppose that the
simpler of this statements is to say

89
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,950
这是一个以身体为中心的立方晶格，但您可以编写一个以身体为中心的立方晶格
it's a body centered cubic lattice but
you can write a body centered cubic

90
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,780
晶格只是说它是简单的三次方，其基础包括一个晶格点
lattice is just saying it's simple cubic
with a basis including one lattice point

91
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:55,920
在一格点处0 0 0处1/2 1/2 1/2很好到目前为止很好现在
at 0 0 0 in one lattice point at 1/2 1/2
1/2 good so far so good all right now

92
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,820
您可能想知道为什么我们使用常规方法会遭受痛苦
you might wonder why is it we're
suffering through using a conventional

93
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:04,170
拥有一个以上单位的晶胞，其中有两个晶格点，而不是
unit cell that has one more you one that
has two lattice points in it instead of

94
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:07,980
使用基本单元，它只有一个晶格点，不是
using a primitive unit cell it only has
one lattice point in it wouldn't that be

95
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,850
比较容易，这是有一个原因，我们不使用基本单元
easier well there's a reason we don't
use a primitive a primitive unit cell

96
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,540
因为原始的晶胞看起来有点丑陋，所以这是个大神经
because the primitive unit cell is kind
of ugly looking so this is the big nur

97
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,210
为BCC晶格定位原始单位单元，它被截断了
sites primitive unit cell for the BCC
lattice and it's it's a truncated

98
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:25,260
八面体我认为它有14个面，您可以看到这里发生了什么
octahedron I think it has 14 sides and
you can kind of see what's going on here

99
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:29,460
在这个立方体的中心，有一个晶格点， 
this is in the center of this cube
there's one of the lattice points and

100
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:33,840
这是八个邻居，您可以看到所有e8邻居和
here are the eight neighbors which you
can see all e8 neighbors and the

101
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,640
六边形面是这两个面之间的垂直平分平面
hexagonal faces are the perpendicularly
bisecting planes between this the

102
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,299
立方体中心的晶格点和立方体角的晶格点
lattice point in the center of the cube
and the lattice point in the corner of

103
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,830
立方体的方形面是两边之间的垂直平分线
the cube the square faces are the
perpendicularly bisect ins between the

104
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,220
立方体中心的晶格点和邻居的晶格点
lattice point in the center of the cube
and the lattice point in the neighbor

105
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,190
使立方体居中，因此，如果您越过一个立方体
centering cube so if you go over one
cube

106
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,740
然后在那个立方体的中心有一个晶格点
and you have a lattice point in the
center of that cube and you make a

107
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,699
垂直平分线平面，为您提供这些正方形的面，记住了方式
perpendicular bisector plane that gives
you these square faces remember the way

108
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:03,120
您通过垂直平分线来构造单元，因此您
you construct the figner sight cells by
making perpendicular bisectors so you

109
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,230
知道太空中最接近该点的一个点
know that everything in space that's
closest to the one lattice point in the

110
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,459
中心在该对象的内部，所以它是一个难看的形状的对象，这就是为什么
center is on the inside of that object
so it's an ugly shaped object that's why

111
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:15,389
我们不将原始单位单元用于BCC晶格，但是如果您采用这些
we don't use primitive unit cells for
the BCC lattice but if you do take these

112
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,939
这些截断的八面体的丑陋形状的物体
ugly shaped objects these truncated
octahedron

113
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:22,439
他们将很好地堆叠在一起，并铺满所有空间
they will stack together very nicely and
tile all the space filling all space

114
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:28,769
因为他们应该没问题，所以还有另一种类型的晶格
appropriately as they're supposed to
okay there's one more type of lattice

115
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:34,040
我们需要讨论哪个是面心立方晶格面
that we need to discuss which is the
face centered cubic lattice face

116
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:50,819
居中居中立方或FCC或立方-f您可能已经注意到我写了一个
centered centered cubic or FCC or cubic
- f you may have noticed that I wrote a

117
00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:54,240
以美国方式而不是英国方式为中心，我这样做的原因是
centered the American way not the
British Way and the reason I do this is

118
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,360
因为我做了另一种方式，我的大脑会爆炸，就是你知道你得到了
because I did the other way my brain
would explode it's just you know you get

119
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,930
曾经以一种方式做某件事，而你只是不能改变任何一种方式都是正确的
used to doing something one way and you
just can't change either way is correct

120
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,310
因此，根据您所在的海洋一侧，让我们看看脸
so depending on the side of the ocean
you're on so let's see what the face

121
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,209
居中的立方晶格看起来像，所以您从一个简单的立方晶格开始
centered cubic lattice looks like so you
start with a the simple cubic lattice

122
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,139
常规单位单元角落的点，然后添加
the points in the corner of the
conventional unit cell and then you add

123
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:17,459
像这样在每个人的脸中央居中
one point in the centre of every face
like this one in the center this place

124
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,040
是这张脸的中心之一，这张脸的中心之一，依此类推
is one of the center this face is one of
the center this face and so forth

125
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,959
里面有多少个晶格点
how many lattice points are there in the

126
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:37,530
所以是的，我将不得不加倍努力，是的，其中有四个要点
so yeah I'm gonna have to make these
harder yes there are four points in the

127
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:43,070
传统上你自己会看到四个点在哪里，八个
conventional yourself there's to see
where the four points are there's eight

128
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:50,640
每个角落都有八分之一，所以传统的里面有1/8 
corners each of which counts one eight
so there's 1/8 inside the conventional

129
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,660
您卖出然后有六个空格，脸中心的点是
you sell then there are six spaces and
the point in the center of the face is

130
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,800
一半在晶胞内，一半在晶胞外，所以是6倍
half inside the unit cell and half
outside the unit cell so it's 6 times

131
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
 1/2等于常规晶胞内的四个晶格点，您也可以
1/2 equals four lattice points within
the conventional unit cell you can also

132
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,320
使用此平面图方案绘制单元格的惯例
draw the convention of the cell with
this this plan view scheme which you

133
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,960
知道所以这里是角落里的要害，正如它所说的未贴标签
know so here are the points in the
corners and it as it says unlabeled

134
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,380
点是高度为0的点，因此此点对应于此点
points are height 0 on a so this point
here corresponds to this point here

135
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:20,790
在a的高度为0的位置上，您可以看到该点的高度
which is at height 0 on a you can see
the points on this on the halfway up the

136
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:24,420
高度超过2的脸，这就是这一点
faces at height labeled a over 2 so
that's this point this point this point

137
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,170
在这一点上，这是这个，这个，这个，然后一个，然后一个
on this point that's this one this one
this one and this one and then the one

138
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:35,610
在这中心的这个高度也是0 
in the center here is also at height 0
on a this one and this one here ok now

139
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:41,490
如果您想象在FCC晶格中将原子或球体排列在一起
if you imagine arranging atoms together
or spheres together in the FCC lattice

140
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,330
配置实际上是您可以打包的最有效方法
configuration it is actually the most
efficient way that you can possibly pack

141
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:48,450
球在一起，因此，如果您有一束网球，您会尝试粘住
spheres together so if you have a bunch
of tennis balls you're trying to stick

142
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,410
把它们装进一个盒子里，把那些网球的最高密度的包装放进去
them into a box the highest density
packing of those tennis balls into the

143
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,130
盒子是FCC格子，还有其他包装，密度也相当
box is an FCC lattice there are other
packings which are equivalently dense

144
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,440
但是您永远不会比FCC包装做得更好，我们不会研究其他包装
but you're never going to do better than
the FCC packing we don't study the other

145
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,860
填料的类型，因为它们没有正交轴，但它们是
types of packings because they don't
have orthogonal axes but they're

146
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,150
实际上等同于FCC，这说明您无法获得更密集的包装
equivalent to FCC in fact this statement
that you can't get a more dense packing

147
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,340
比FCC的原子数由开普勒（Kepler）在1611年推测
of atoms than FCC was conjectured by
Kepler in 1611

148
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:20,130
它只是在1998年被证明的，所以它是一个长期存在的定理，但是
and it was only proven in 1998 so it's a
very long standing standing theorem but

149
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:23,250
事实证明，你不能做得更好，不能打包
it turns out to be true
you can't do any better you can't pack

150
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,190
如果有担心，可以将更多的东西放到狭小的空间中，然后使用FCC晶格
more things into a small space if
there's fears then using FCC lattice

151
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:31,590
因为如果你考虑原子，那么你会在一个狭小的空间里放很多长矛
because you get so many Spears in a
small space if you think about atoms

152
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,260
试图吸引对方，这是很普遍的，这是非常有吸引力的
trying to attract each other it's a very
common it's a very appealing a

153
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,010
原子的组态，因此许多元素采用FCC组态
configuration for atoms and so many
elements take FCC configurations

154
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:49,589
铜，银，金，钙，许多其他都可以通过FCC进行，所以既然有四个
copper silver gold calcium many others
are FCC okay so since there are four

155
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:55,490
每个单位晶格的原子，我们应该能够在输入4时查看FCC晶格
atoms per unit cell we should be able to
view the FCC lattice as 4 enter

156
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:00,240
互穿简单的立方晶格，所以让我们看看是否可以看到这是
interpenetrating simple cubic lattices
so let's see if we can see that this is

157
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,820
 FCC球体晶格，这是我标出的简单立方
an FCC lattice of spheres and this is
the red I have marked out a simple cubic

158
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,690
格子这是一个简单的立方体，很难看，但是您可以
lattice this is a simple cube it's a
little hard to see but then you can

159
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,420
如果您仔细看的话，请选择其他三个
actually pick out if you look very
carefully there are three other

160
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:19,620
相互渗透的简单立方晶格，在这里和尽管
interpenetrating simple cubic lattices
which are mixed in here and although it

161
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,750
每个球体的环境可能并不完全清楚
may not be completely obvious that the
environment of every single sphere is

162
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,649
现在与其他领域的环境相同，因为那不是
identical to the environment of every
other sphere now since that's not

163
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:32,699
完全显而易见，我们应该练习一下写下
completely obvious we should do the
exercise of actually writing down the

164
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:40,829
 FCC晶格的晶格矢量我声称它们采用
lattice vectors lattice vectors for the
FCC lattice and I claim they take the

165
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:55,589
再次形成UV w UV W乘以a，其中一个UV W都为整数
form again UV w UV W times a where
either one UV W all integer and again

166
00:13:55,589 --> 00:14:00,149
这将对应于备份另一个
that would correspond backing up one
more that would correspond to the the

167
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:05,550
将所有整数都指向角，所以这个1是1 0 0这是1 1 0并且
points in the corners all integers so
this one is is 1 0 0 this is 1 1 0 and

168
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,940
等等，还有其他可能性，所以紫外线W 
so forth and so on
the other possibility so UV W we're

169
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:22,790
要么可能性1都是整数，要么其中两个都是半奇数
either either possibility 1 they're all
integers or to two of them are half odd

170
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:34,579
整数和一个整数
integer and one integer

171
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,570
好吧，我们将证明它确实有效，但在继续之前
okay so we're gonna show that this
actually works but before going on so

172
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:49,010
再来一个巧克力，什么是协调
for the one one more chocolate
what is the coordination of the

173
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,380
协调数12让我们实际上在此图上看到的是
coordination numbers 12 let's actually
see on this on this on this plot y it is

174
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,190
协调号码是12我要停止问问题
the coordination number is is 12 I'm
gonna stop asking questions I'm gonna

175
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:04,520
这样运行巧克力，我将不得不问更难的问题
run that chocolate this way I'm gonna
have to ask harder questions okay

176
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:08,810
因此，如果您看到协调编号12，那么我们将这个领域
so if you see the coordination numbers
12 let's take this sphere here the one

177
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,400
它被切成两半，在同一高度有四个邻居一二三四
that's cut in half it has four neighbors
one two three four at the same height it

178
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,000
有四个邻居，高度略低一些，您可以看到其中两个
has four neighbors at a slightly lower
height here you can see two of them that

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
也触摸它，然后如果您走到更高的高度， 
are touching it also and then if you
went to a slightly higher height the

180
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,480
距离这些下降的距离相同，您将再有四个距离，因此
same distance up that these are down you
would have four more so it's forth the

181
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,660
高度略低而略高的相同高度
same height for slightly lower and for
slightly higher which may not look all

182
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,620
令人信服，但我们可以使用此规则进行显示，因此该规则可以使
that convincing but we can show it using
this rule so this rule would give that

183
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,030
免费给我们的原因，我们知道这是因为
to us for free
the reason we would know this is because

184
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:41,210
如果您看的很好，首先让我们来
if you if you look at this point here
well first of all let's let's take a

185
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:44,750
看看这个项目到这里，他们两个都有奇数整数之一
look at this this item to here the two
of them have odd integer one of them

186
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,780
整数对应于什么，对应于
integer what does that correspond to
that corresponds to someone in the

187
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:52,640
例如脸部中间，这个家伙他已经回来了一半多
middle of the face for example this guy
here he's over one-half he's back

188
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,870
二分之一，但他的身高和整数身高，而这个家伙在这里，他已经结束了
one-half but he's up and integer height
whereas this guy over here he's over

189
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,070
他的一半上升了一半，但他的身高是整数，恰好是他的深度
one-half he's up one half but his height
is an integer it happens to be his depth

190
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,800
是一个整数，这个是1/2以上1/2的整数，他是整数，所以如果
is an integer this one here is over 1/2
up 1/2 and he's an integer back so if

191
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,420
它在脸上有两个一半的整数，如果有一个，则有一个整数
it's on a face it has two half out
integers and one integer if it's on a

192
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:19,040
角都是全整数，现在我们可以检查我们可以再次检查这里
corner it's all integers now we can
check we can check here that again we

193
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,160
应该具有以下规则：如果您将这些集合中的任何两项添加到彼此
should have the rule that if you add any
two things from these sets to each other

194
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,690
您应该从这些集合之一中获取一些东西，例如
you should get back something from this
from one of these sets so for example if

195
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:30,440
您添加引入两个整数，如果您将整数添加到
you add introduce two integers you get
back integers if you add integers to

196
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,740
半个奇数整数和一个整数，您会得到回报，您知道以下事实： 
half odd integers and one integer you'll
get back you know the fact that you're

197
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,200
向某物添加整数不会改变它是否是一半整数
adding integers to something doesn't
change whether it's a half out integer

198
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,220
或整数，以便您再次获得第二组中的某项，但这不是
or an integer so you get back something
in the set two again but what's not

199
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,400
很明显，您需要做两件事，其中有两个半数整数和一个
obvious is you take two things which
have two half out integers and one

200
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,720
整数并将它们加在一起会得到什么，所以让我们尝试一下，如果有
integer and you add them together what
do you get so let's try so if you have

201
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,370
例如一半一半一半，然后将其添加到三个
for example one half
one half one and you add it to three

202
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,610
将一半减半，所以这两个都是其中一半我将整数之一
halves one half zero so both of these
are two of them half I'd integers one of

203
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,110
它们是整数，所以它们都在脸上，您会得到2逗号1逗号1 
them integers so both of these would be
on the face you get 2 comma 1 comma 1

204
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,059
都是整数，这很好，但是我可以用不同的方式来做
which is all integers and that's good
but I could have done it differently you

205
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:17,179
本来可以有一个一半一个一半一个说一半的一半0 3一半
could have had one half one half one
added to say one half 0 3 halves for

206
00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:24,980
例子，那么你得到的是1个逗号1个半逗号3个一半，还有两个
example then what do you get is 1 comma
1 half comma 3 halves and still two of

207
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,799
它们是1/2个奇数整数，其中一个是整数，所以如果加
them are 1/2 odd integers and one of
them is an integer so if you add

208
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,480
集合B的两件事在一起，您会从集合B中得到某事
together two things from set B you'll
get either something from set wasthat be

209
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,770
设置为您会从设置1或设置2中得到一些东西，因此它形成一个
set to you get either something from set
1 or something from set 2 so it forms a

210
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,429
假设我们知道这些是坐标，则加法下的闭集
closed set under addition now given that
we know that these are the coordinates

211
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:47,030
 FCC格子中的向量的，让我们看看是否可以找出
of the of the vectors in the FCC lattice
let's see if we can figure out that that

212
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,360
协调编号12更容易一点，让我们从这一点开始
coordination number 12 a little more
easily so let's start with this point

213
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:58,400
这就是0 0 0的点，并寻找最接近0 0 0的东西最接近0 
here that's the point 0 0 0 and look for
the closest things to 0 0 0 closest to 0

214
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:06,200
 0 0好吧好吧这家伙看起来很近，他的警戒线是1/2 1/2逗号
0 0 okay well okay this guy here looks
pretty close his cordon is 1/2 1/2 comma

215
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,130
 0，所以1/2 1/2逗号为0，如果它符合以下点之一的定义
0 so 1/2 1/2 comma 0 and if that fits
the definition of one of the points in

216
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:16,549
 FCC晶格中的两个是一半整数，其中一个是整数， 
the FCC lattice two of them half out
integers one of them integer and it's

217
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,549
非常接近无法接近，但我们可以
pretty close
can't get any closer but we could have

218
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:23,090
做这个正负，我们也可以做这个正负
made this plus or minus and we could
have made this plus or minus as well

219
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:27,559
正确的是，这些也都符合定义，我们可以将0放入
right that those all fit the definition
as well and we could have put the 0 in

220
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:34,460
三个地点中的任何一个，三种可能性，所以我们有四个
any of the three spots three
possibilities so we have four

221
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,970
这些加号或减号的可能性以及何处的三种可能性
possibilities of these plus or minus
signs and three possibilities of where

222
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:42,309
你把零，所以我们得到4乘以3等于12是协调数
you put the zero so we get 4 times 3
equals 12 is the coordination number

223
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:54,860
好吧好吧好吧，所以还值得写下一些原始的
okay good okay all right so it's worth
also writing down a set of primitive

224
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:00,740
 FCC晶格的晶格矢量，因此FCC晶格的POV确实非常好
lattice vectors for the FCC lattice so
POVs for the FCC lattice a really good

225
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,360
例如，最接近的向量使它们很好剥皮
example are just the closest
vectors are make pretty good peel these

226
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:21,820
所以1/2 1/2 0倍1/2 0 1/2倍+ 0 1/2 1/2倍
so 1/2 1/2 0 times a 1/2 0 1/2 times a +
0 1/2 1/2 times a make pretty good

227
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:26,420
它们在那里是原始晶格向量，一次又一次地使自己相信它们
primitive lattice vectors there they are
and again to convince yourself that they

228
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,450
确实是原始晶格向量，我们要做的就是说服自己
really are primitive lattice vectors
what we have to do is convince ourselves

229
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,690
我们可以通过添加整数到达FCC晶格上的每个点
that we can get to every point on the
FCC lattice by adding integer

230
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,160
它们的组合，例如，如果我们想在这里达到这一点
combinations of them so for example if
we wanted to get to this point here

231
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,210
我们将不得不将其中每个添加1个，因此将这个添加为1个
we would have to add 1 of each of them
so this one this one plus this one would

232
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:45,290
带我们到这里，如果我们想到达这里，我们将不得不添加mmm 
take us to here and if we wanted to get
to here we would have to add mmm well

233
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,540
我不确定是的，您如何到达其中两个，然后减去-1 
I'm not sure yeah okay how do you get
there two of these and then minus 1 of

234
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:54,590
这些或其他内容，无论如何，您都可以使用它，它可以正常工作
these or something and anyway so you can
play around with it you it works you can

235
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:59,570
到达那里你如何到达这里嗯是的，这将是其中的两个
get there how do you how do you get here
um yeah so it would be two of these

236
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:07,730
会把你带到这里，那么你可能需要减去一-是其中之一，再加上
would get you here then you need maybe
minus one yeah - one of these then plus

237
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,460
其中之一是某种可以让您顺利到达的东西
one of these there's something that will
get you there okay anyway

238
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:23,570
好吧，因为FCC晶格具有FCC晶格，每个FCC晶格具有四个四个晶格点
alright so since the FCC lattice has FCC
lattice has four four lattice points per

239
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,830
常规单位单元，就像我们对BCC所做的那样，我们可以将其编写为简单
conventional unit cell just like we did
with the BCC we could write it as simple

240
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:35,559
立方简单立方乘以基数乘以基数，其中基数现在包括
cubic simple cubic times the basis times
a basis where the basis now includes

241
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:46,720
基数等于0 0 0的点等于1/2 1/2 0的点等于1/2 0 
basis equals the point at 0 0 0 the
point at 1/2 1/2 0 the point at 1/2 0

242
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,140
 1/2和0 1/2 1/2的点会给我四个晶格点
1/2 and the point at 0 1/2 1/2 that
would give me the four lattice points

243
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,059
每个单位单元格，如果我按照惯例翻译了这四个晶格点
per unit cell and if I translate those
four lattice points in my convention

244
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,860
他们会卖到每个格子点
they'd sell around to every lattice
point

245
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,210
所以晶格点在0 0 0，然后这些都从原始位置移开
so lattice points at 0 0 0 and then
these are all displace from the original

246
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,870
将重建整个面为中心的立方晶格的晶格点或
lattice point that will reconstruct the
entire face centered cubic lattice or

247
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,400
另一种思考方式是这些是四个的位移
another way of thinking about it is
these are the displacements of the four

248
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,760
互穿构成FCC晶格的简单立方晶格
interpenetrating simple cubic lattices
that make up the FCC lattice

249
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:25,090
与BCC晶格一样，有一个原因是我们不使用基本单位单元
as with the BCC lattice there's a reason
we don't use the primitive unit cell for

250
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,460
它使用传统的单元格而不是原始单元格，因为
it we use a conventional you cell not
the primitive unit cell because the

251
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:31,940
原始单元格在这里非常丑陋，它被截短到十进制
primitive unit cell is extremely ugly
here it is it's a truncated to deca

252
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:36,080
 heatran它具有12个面，这12个面对应于12个最近的邻居
heatran it has 12 sides those 12 sides
correspond to the 12 nearest neighbors

253
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,200
所以我们在中心的是晶格点之一，然后我们有
so what we have in the center is one of
the lattice points and then we have the

254
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,350
 12个最近的邻居，其中四个在同一位置略高于
12 nearest neighbors four of them
slightly above for them at the same

255
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:47,150
高度，并形成在略低于正十二面体的下面和面中
height and formed in slightly below and
the faces of the truncated dodecahedron

256
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:53,180
这是0和和之间的线段的垂直平分线
here are the perpendicular bisectors of
the segment between 0 and the and the

257
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,620
和最近的邻居好吧，这就是我们需要了解的FCC 
and the nearest neighbors okay alright
that's all we need to know about the FCC

258
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,580
实际上这就是我们要使用的所有三个三维晶格
lattice in fact that's all the three
dimensional lattices we're going to

259
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:08,210
研究值得一提的是，总共有14种晶格
study it is worth knowing that there are
14 types of lattices in in all the ones

260
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,110
我们已经研究了立方本原体
we've studied are the cubic primitive
the cubic body-centered the cubic

261
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,680
以面子为中心，我们还讨论了四边形简单tr三角形和
face-centered we also talked about the
tetragonal simple trent trigonal and

262
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,340
简单的斜方晶，然后您在这里有一堆其他的
simple orthorhombic and then you have a
whole bunch of other ones here you may

263
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:23,660
注意那里有类似物，所以我们不需要知道身体的类似物
notice that there's there's analog so we
don't need to know analogues of the body

264
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,630
中心四角形体中心斜方面中心正交面
centered tetragonal body centred
orthorhombic face centred orthorhombic

265
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,490
依此类推，您可能会注意到没有以四角形为中心的人脸，其原因是
and so forth you may notice there's no
face centered tetragonal and the reason

266
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:36,110
因为这实际上是因为通过横向旋转晶格
for that is because in fact by turning
the lattice sideways it would be in one

267
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,830
以及其他类别的东西，所以无论如何您都将过度计算
of the other classes as well so you
would be over counting so anyway these

268
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,190
在brav a是谁之后，有时称为brav a晶格类型
are sometimes known as the brav a
lattice types after brav a who is the

269
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:49,070
第一人称正确写下来，所以我们赞扬
first person to write them down
correctly and so we give brav a credit

270
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,160
为此，这些是您可能拥有的唯一可能的晶格类型
for doing them so these are the only
possible lattice types you can have it's

271
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,690
一种深层的数学陈述，即三个周期中的任何周期结构
kind of a deep mathematical statement
that any periodic structure in three

272
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,050
您可以在三个维度中拥有的任何维度都是其中之一
dimensions anything you can have in
three dimensions is one of these

273
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,490
晶格乘以某个基础，所以如果您可以写下所有这些晶格，您
lattices times some basis so if you can
write down all these lattices and you

274
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,090
可以选择任何依据，无论您做任何事情多么复杂
can have any basis you choose no matter
how complicated you can make anything

275
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:12,890
任何周期性结构都是这些晶格之一乘以某些基数
any periodic structure is one of these
lattices times some bases the only ones

276
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,860
我们实际上必须要知道今年是三个立方，而这个和
we're actually gonna have to know this
year are the three cubics and this and

277
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,940
这三个简单的立方四方正交晶体很少需要
the three simple cubic tetragonal
orthorhombic very rarely do we need to

278
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,910
知道泰德·龙格定理，因为我很少参加考试
know Ted dragonlore theorem because I
only rarely come up on exams it's really

279
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:27,160
这三个在考试中名列前茅的好吗
these three across the top that actually
show up on exams okay

280
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,620
所以这是你可以放一个例子
so
this is an example of what you can put

281
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,990
当你有晶格和基础时，这是钠
together when you when you have a
lattice and a basis this is a sodium

282
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,710
氯化物结构非常典型的盐结构氯化钠非常离子
chloride structure a very typical salt
structure sodium chloride very ionic

283
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:47,460
钠释放电子氯会吸收电子，如果您看一下
sodium gives up the electron chlorine
takes the electron and if you look at it

284
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,600
仔细地您会看到钠正在形成FCC晶格，甚至
carefully you can see that sodium is
forming an FCC lattice this is even

285
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,320
标有立方的f，所以也许最容易在这张照片中看到这些
labeled cubic f so maybe it's easiest to
see in this picture these are all

286
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:01,020
同一格的描绘实际上都不是很好，但我们可能有
depictions of the same lattice none of
them are actually great but we may have

287
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:05,970
为此，您可以在这张图片中以FCC的形式看到此处的绿色球体。 
to make do so here you can see the green
spheres here in this picture form an FCC

288
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,640
格子，所以它也位于脸部的角和中心
lattice so it's on the corners and in
the center of the faces as well but in

289
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,800
除了FCC晶格上的钠原子外，还有氯
addition to the sodium atoms which are
on the FCC lattice there are chlorine

290
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,240
原子也可以这样说： 
atoms as well and you can describe the
position of the chlorine atoms by saying

291
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,530
每一个钠原子都有一个氯原子被二分之一取代
for every sodium atom there is a
chlorine atom displaced by one half one

292
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:30,150
钠原子的一半一半将使您处于
half one half from the sodium atom that
will that will get you the position of

293
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,560
所有的氯原子都是平面图蓝调是钠的
all the chlorine atoms here's a plan
view the Blues would be the sodium's and

294
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,970
氯，例如，如果我开始加钠，然后超过一半
the chlorines so for example if I
started a sodium and I go over a half

295
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:45,120
返回一半然后再向上延伸一半到下一层当我到达一个氯原子时
back a half and then up a half to the
next layer I get to a chlorine atom when

296
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,530
描述基础时，应始终描述基本单元的基础
you describe a basis you should always
describe the basis of the primitive unit

297
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,790
单元格，所以在这里我不告诉您这四个我不谈论的地方
cell so here I don't tell you where all
the four I don't talk about the

298
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,480
传统的晶胞，它只有四个钠和四个氯
conventional unit cell which would have
four sodium's and four chlorines I just

299
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,830
告诉你这是一个FCC格子，马上你知道
tell you there's it's an FCC lattice and
immediately you know that the

300
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,830
传统的静音单元将在其中和位置上具有四个晶格点
conventional muted cell will have four
lattice points in it and on the position

301
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:09,570
在零零零处有一个钠蓝色，然后从
of the lattice at zero zero zero there's
a sodium blue and then displace from

302
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,680
我把1/2 1/2 1/2加了氯，所以我只想向你描述一个
that by 1/2 1/2 1/2 I put a chlorine so
I only have to describe to you one

303
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,340
钠和一氯可以告诉你一切，一旦我告诉你这是
sodium and one chlorine to tell you
everything once I've told you it's a

304
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:24,000
简单立方，这是FCC晶格注意，我不是唯一的方式
simple cubic it's a it's a FCC lattice
notice also that it's not unique how I

305
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,790
描述了氯的位置相对于氯的位置
described the position of the chlorine
with respect to the position of the

306
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:30,960
钠我本可以告诉你，氯被置换为1/2 0 0 
sodium I could have told you that the
chlorine was displaced 1/2 0 0 that

307
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,890
会给您相同的结构，或者我可能已经决定氯
would give you the equivalent structure
or I could have decided that chlorine

308
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,430
是我的零零零，钠是这个地方，它也会给
was my zero zero zero and sodium was
this place from it that would also give

309
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,760
您具有同等的结构，因此有多种不同的方式来描述
you an equivalent structure so there's
various different ways to describe the

310
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,150
相同的晶格这是我们运行的另一个结构
same the same lattice
here's another structure that we run

311
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:49,350
变成非常常见的金刚石结构碳
into very frequently the diamond
structure carbon it also is the

312
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:54,270
硅和锗的结构也基于FCC晶格，因此您可以
structure of silicon and germanium it is
also based on the FCC lattice so you can

313
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,900
举例来说，在上面，有一个家伙，有一个家伙， 
see for example on the top face here
there's some guy there's one in all the

314
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,380
边角在一个角或中心，侧面是一个
corners and there's one or in the center
of the face the side face is one in all

315
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,890
角在脸中央有一个，依此类推，所以肯定
the corners there's one in the center of
the face and so forth so it's definitely

316
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:09,060
里面有FCC格子，但那并不能告诉您所有
has an FCC lattice in it but then that
that doesn't tell you where all the

317
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,390
碳的位置上还有其他碳，您可以描述
positions of the carbons are there
additional carbons and you can describe

318
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,020
碳的位置被四分之一取代
the position of the carbons by just as
being displaced by one quarter one

319
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,620
从每个晶格点开始四分之一四分之一，因此例如在平面图中
quarter one quarter from every lattice
point so for example in the plan view we

320
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,450
从0 0 0处的碳开始，然后我们将四分之一四分之一位移
start with this carbon at 0 0 0 and then
we displace by a quarter one quarter one

321
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:29,010
季度，我们也在该位置找到另一个碳，所以我再也没有
quarter and we find another carbon at
that position as well so again I don't

322
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,670
必须描述所有八个碳在常规碳中的位置
have to describe the position of all of
the eight carbons in the conventional

323
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:37,110
晶胞我只需要告诉你这是一个FCC晶格，并且它有一个
unit cell I only have to tell you that
it's an FCC lattice and and it has a

324
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,910
以两个原子为基础，一个在0 0 0，一个在1/4 1/4 1/4，这足以
basis of two atoms one at 0 0 0 and one
at 1/4 1/4 1/4 and that's sufficient to

325
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:52,290
好好描述一切，什么是格子，什么是
describe everything ok all right
what'swhat's the lattice what is the

326
00:26:52,290 --> 00:27:00,450
晶格是什么晶格是什么晶格是有基础的晶格
lattice what is the lattice what it is a
lattice it's a lattice with a basis what

327
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,280
谁说的FCC格子类型好好好
what lattice type who said it FCC ok ok
good

328
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,330
哇，这是坐起来很方便的好处
Wow see this is advantage to sitting up
close you get more chocolate that way

329
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,510
顺便说一句，我尝试了一些
incidentally I switched from chocolate
types because I tried some of the

330
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,320
昨天的巧克力不好吃，所以希望有一点更好
chocolate yesterday wasn't all that good
so there hopefully this bit it's better

331
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,390
你们我是巧克力鉴赏家好吧，这是FCC，所以这是镓
you guys I'm chocolate connoisseur okay
so it's FCC it's it's so this is gallium

332
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,810
砷化物结构也称为锌混合结构
arsenide structure also known as the
zinc blende structure it's exactly the

333
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:30,090
与钻石结构相同，不同之处在于您已经获取了第二碳并
same as the diamond structure except
that you've taken the second carbon and

334
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:33,420
你把它变成了不同类型的原子，所以在这里让我向你展示
you turn it into a different type of
atom so here let me actually to show you

335
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:40,500
所以在我们FCC的F形中的黄色，所以您可以看到黄色原子
so the yellow at our F form at FCC so
you can see that the the yellow atoms

336
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,980
在脸部的角落和中心说，例如，这是一张脸
say in the corners and the centre of the
faces so for example here here's a face

337
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,300
中间有一个黄色然后蓝调被1/4 1/4 1/4取代
and there's a yellow in the center of it
then the Blues are displaced 1/4 1/4 1/4

338
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,920
从每个黄色原子开始，有些您知道它看起来有些令人困惑
from every yellow atom now some of the
you know it may look a little puzzling

339
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,740
看起来我们有比黄色原子更多的黄色原子，但我们没有
it looks like we have more yellow atoms
than we have blue atoms but we don't

340
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,830
因为有些黄色是我们晶胞内仅有的一半
because some of the yellow
our only half inside the unit cell the

341
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:03,899
 FCC在晶胞内有四个晶格点，因此应该有
FCC there's four lattice points within
the unit cell and so there should be

342
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,619
四个黄色原子（如果算在内的话）包括八分之一
four yellow atoms if you count them
including you know it's half an eighth

343
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,289
如果它在拐角处，一半在侧面，您会算黄色
if it's on the corner and a half of its
on the side you'll count for yellow

344
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:14,070
原子，然后它们显然是完全位于单元内部的四个蓝色原子
atoms and then they're obviously four
blue atoms completely inside the unit

345
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,249
单元格还可以，还有一个评论，如果Mike Glaser，这是一个微妙的地方
cell as well okay um one more comment
this is a subtlety if Mike Glaser

346
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:23,489
碰巧是你的老师，他会很高兴我告诉你他是一个真正的
happens to be your tutor he'll be very
happy that I tell you this he's a real

347
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:26,639
清澈的晶体学家，他总是把我的脚扶在火上，迫使我
clear crystallographer and he always
holds my feet to the fire to force me to

348
00:28:26,639 --> 00:28:30,809
以真实的方式讲事物，不讲任何谎言，所以我在这里讲
tell things the way they really are and
not tell any lies so here I'm gonna tell

349
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:34,799
你的微妙之处，不要告诉你任何谎言，所以假设我们有一个像
you the subtlety and not tell you any
lies so suppose we have a material like

350
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,339
这似乎是一个简单的三次系统，以三个为基础
this it appears to be a simple cubic
system with a basis of three there's one

351
00:28:41,339 --> 00:28:44,159
在拐角处，然后在中心的两个地方，它们不正确
on the corners and then two somewhere in
the center they're not right in the

352
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,359
中心，所以它不是密件抄送，但中心有两个地方，有一个
center so it's not BCC but there's two
somewhere in the center and there's one

353
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:52,139
并由八个角落共享，所以我们可以说这是一个简单的立方体
and shared by all the eight corners so
we would say it's a simple cubic with a

354
00:28:52,139 --> 00:28:58,049
如果我测量这个立方体的边缘，现在包括三个三三个原子
basis including three three three atoms
now if I measure the edges of this cube

355
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:01,200
我说它们都是相同的aa和a以及所有三个方向
and I say they're all the same a a and a
and all the three directions I would say

356
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,969
如果您很想说这是简单的立方晶体，但是
it's if you would be tempted to say it's
simple cubic crystal but a

357
00:29:05,969 --> 00:29:09,479
晶体学家会说不是，而他们会说不是
crystallographers would say it's not and
the reason they would say it's not is

358
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:13,259
因为它没有简单立方物体的对称性
because it doesn't have the symmetry of
a simple cubic object a simple cubic

359
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:16,409
对象，您应该能够将其在所有六个方向上旋转，并且它看起来
object you should be able to turn it in
all six directions and it should look

360
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:19,589
不管您从哪个方向看，它都不会
the same whichever direction you look at
it from and this thing doesn't look the

361
00:29:19,589 --> 00:29:22,739
如果从顶部看，就像从侧面看一样
same if you look at it from the top as
from as if you look at it from the side

362
00:29:22,739 --> 00:29:26,399
结晶学家为什么知道这么重要
why is that important well the
crystallographer knows that if it

363
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,450
没有对称性，没有充分的理由将其高度设置为
doesn't have the symmetry there's no
good reason that its height should be

364
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:33,749
与其宽度相同，但不相同，在任何意义上都不相等
the same as its width they're not the
same they're not equivalent in any sense

365
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:37,799
因此高度不必与宽度相同，所以如果我告诉你
so the height doesn't have to be the
same as the width and so if I tell you

366
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:40,859
边缘的长度相同，他会说去测量
well the the the edges have the same
length he would say well go measure it

367
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,499
仔细一点，您会发现它们的长度不一样，所以
more carefully and you'll discover
they're not the same length so the

368
00:29:43,499 --> 00:29:46,769
晶体学家知道边缘是否有很好的对称性原因
crystallographer knows if there's not a
good symmetry reason for the edge

369
00:29:46,769 --> 00:29:50,129
长度是相同的，那么他们是不一样的，如果我是晶体学家
lengths to be the same then they're not
the same and a crystallographer if I

370
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,789
写下这个，晶体学家会回来找我，说不
wrote this down the crystallographer
would come back to me and say no they're

371
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:56,729
实际上长度不一样，您只是以为它们长度相同所以就去
actually not the same length you just
think they're the same length so go

372
00:29:56,729 --> 00:29:59,190
再次测量，您会发现它们的长度不一样
measure it again and you'll discover
them they're not the same length it

373
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,669
如果没有很好的对称原因，这将是一个令人难以置信的巧合
would be an unbelievable coincidence if
there was not a good symmetry reason for

374
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,970
边缘的长度相同，最终导致人
the edges to be the same length and they
ended up people

375
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,870
长度一样可以让真正的晶体学家高兴
being the same length okay so that's to
make the real crystallographers happy

376
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:15,890
这就是我们今天要说的关于晶体结构的所有内容，所以很好
and that is all we have to say about
crystal structure for today okay good so

377
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:20,000
现在，我们已经了解了三个晶体结构所需的所有知识
we've now learned everything we need to
know about crystal structure in three

378
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,750
确定我们将要讨论的所有晶格的尺寸
dimensions all the lattices we're going
to have to discuss we know about

379
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,330
格子和花瓶，但归根结底，我们真的想形容
lattices and vases but at the end of the
day we really want to describe physical

380
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,500
这些晶体中的现象，而且通常不是我们感兴趣的现象
phenomena in these crystals and more
often than not what we're interested in

381
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,919
是某种波，无论是振动波还是声子
is waves of some sort whether the
vibrational waves or phonons whether

382
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:40,130
它们是电子波，无论是电磁波还是
they're electron waves whether
electromagnetic waves and the world of

383
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:45,200
方式是互惠空间的世界，所以我们必须备份并了解一些
ways is the world of reciprocal space so
we have to back up and understand some

384
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,630
当我们拥有复杂的晶体时，关于互易空间的事情，让我们
things about reciprocal space when we
have complicated crystals so let's

385
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:54,169
提醒自己一些我们在一个互惠空间中学到的东西
remind ourselves some things we learned
about this reciprocal space in one

386
00:30:54,169 --> 00:31:01,250
一维很好，我们有一个形式为R sub的直接晶格
dimension well in one dimension we had a
direct lattice lattice of the form R sub

387
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:07,520
 N等于N的乘积，并且整数a是原始晶格矢量p lv 
N equals a times N and was the integer a
was the primitive lattice vector p lv

388
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:15,820
然后从直接空间我们得到倒数空间倒数格
and then from direct space we have the
reciprocal space reciprocal lattice

389
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:24,679
我们可以这样写：GM乘以M等于2 pi现在这里a的2 PI是
which we can write as G M equals 2 pi
over a times M now here 2 PI over a is

390
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,299
倒数空间中的本征格向量
the primitive lattice vector in
reciprocal space primitive lattice

391
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:34,220
现在倒数晶格的向量为什么为什么我们选择这个作为
vector for the reciprocal lattice now
why was it that we chose this to be the

392
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:41,270
倒数晶格很好，我们选择它是因为如果您取K 2 K加任何
reciprocal lattice well we chose it
because if you take K 2 K plus any

393
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:50,090
倒数晶格中的元素GM我们以相同的方式得到相同的结果
element GM in the reciprocal lattice we
get back the same way gets same way why

394
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:59,960
那好吧，让我们仔细地将e移到IK点RK点R上， 
is that well let's do carefully e to the
I K dot R K dot R gets shifted to e to

395
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:12,580
 IK加G m点RN，等于e等于IK点R ne 
the I K plus G m dot RN and that
becomes equals e to the I K dot R n e to

396
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:21,280
 i GM RN，这是一个因素，因为这是一个，因为
the i GM RN and this factor here is just
one because it's this is one because it

397
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:31,270
 e到I到PI的时间是M乘以n的整数倍，所以我们要
is e to the I to PI over a times M times
a times n that's just one so we're going

398
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:35,650
将其概括为另外两个维度
to generalize that in two more
dimensions in any dimension in any

399
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:46,450
我们定义的维以找到倒数晶格定义
dimension we define to find the
reciprocal lattice define resupply

400
00:32:46,450 --> 00:33:02,100
 tiss-you SIPP Flat oh yeah points as points GG vector that that e 
tiss-you SIPP flat oh yeah
points as points G G vector such that e

401
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:16,620
到i g-- m点RN o kg，我们不要在其上加上索引，但g RN等于1 
to the i g-- m dot RN o kg let's not put
an index on it yet g RN equals 1 for all

402
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:23,220
因为所有人都在直接晶格中
for all are and in direct lattice

403
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:30,250
间接晶格，所以这是我们对等晶格的一般定义
indirect lattice so this is our general
definition of the reciprocal lattice

404
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:37,240
倒数晶格中的向量G现在这是一个很好的定义
vectors G in the reciprocal lattice now
this is a nice definition it's a very

405
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,919
有用的定义，但我没有以任何方式向您证明此定义
useful definition but I have not in any
way proven to you that this definition

406
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,880
定义了我声称的晶格，但定义了晶格，但我没有显示
defines the lattice that I've claimed it
defines the lattice but I haven't shown

407
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:51,280
您定义一个晶格并证明倒数空间中的点集G 
you it defines a lattice and the proof
the set of points G in reciprocal space

408
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,860
对于直接晶格中的所有RN，满足此等式的方程等于1 
that satisfy this equation equals 1 for
all RN in the direct lattice the proof

409
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,549
定义互易空间中的晶格有点微妙， 
that that defines a lattice in
reciprocal space is a little subtle and

410
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:06,880
有点棘手，所以我们将通过它来看看是否可以做到
a little tricky so we're going to go
through it let's see if we can make it

411
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,239
说服它是真的，所以首先我们将采用直接晶格
convincing that it's true so first of
all we'll take the direct lattice

412
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,979
我们必须定义直接晶格矢量的因素直接晶格矢量

413
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,960
接下来，我们将根据原始晶格因子来写它们，因此R等于n1 
next we'll write them in terms of the
primitive lattice factors so R equals n1

414
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:27,940
 a 1加n 2 a 2加n 3 a 3其中原始晶格因子的A 
a 1 plus n 2 a 2 plus n 3 a 3 where the
A's of the primitive lattice factors

415
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,330
我们的PL V的A是PL，这些是原始晶格向量，所以我们
our pl V's A's are PL these are the
primitive lattice vectors okay so we've

416
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:38,560
现在定义了直接晶格，然后我们将猜测我要制作一个
defined the direct lattice now and then
we're going to guess I'm going to make a

417
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,239
猜测这是一个很好的猜测，这是正确的猜测，我们将
guess of what this is a very good guess
it's correct guess and we're gonna have

418
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:49,209
为了证明这一点，请稍后猜测POV的PL v。 

419
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:53,280
每个小伙子互惠的格子
reciprocal lattice every sip lad

420
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,580
我们将它们称为B sub I，并将其与直接晶格的sub I进行比较，我们将
we'll call them B sub I is compared to a
sub I for the direct lattice and we'll

421
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:08,040
通过以下等式b定义它们，sub j等于2 pi 
define them by the following equation b
sub i gotted with a sub j equals 2 pi

422
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:14,740
 Delta IJ这是一个非常重要的方程式
Delta IJ it's a rather important
equation now first thing you might

423
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:18,730
想知道如何直接给定一组原始晶格向量
wonder is how do I know given a set of
primitive lattice vectors in direct

424
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:25,690
我怎么知道有一组向量B满足这个
space a how do I know that there's a set
of vectors B which satisfies this this

425
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,349
对偶空间对偶向量空间基础的方程式排序
equation sort of a dual space dual
vector space basis well there's a fairly

426
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,670
向您展示可以通过一些帮助找到蜜蜂的简便方法，方法是编写
easy way to show you that you can find
bees given some aids which is by writing

427
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,800
他们写下来，让我们写下来，所以bi等于2 
them down
so let's write them down so bi equals 2

428
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:55,869
 pi aj cross ak over让我们看到一个1点缀成2个cross并3个
pi aj cross a k over let's see a 1
dotted into a 2 cross a 3 okay and this

429
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:07,690
对于ijk等于1 2 3或3 1 2或2 3 1，所以以循环方式，所以我主张
is for ijk equals to 1 2 3 or 3 1 2 or 2
3 1 so in the cyclical way so I claim

430
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,420
 B的表达式将满足B的定义并对其进行检查
that this expression for B will satisfy
this definition of B and to check it

431
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:18,490
让我们来找出它是否正确，所以以B 1为例
let's uh let's just find out if it's
true so let's take for example B 1

432
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:29,950
点上1的点，这样写出来B 1 B 1是2 pi a 2跨过点1上的3 
dotted with a 1 so well write out B 1 B
1 is 2 pi a 2 cross a 3 over a 1 dotted

433
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:34,790
用2交叉3，然后我们将其点到1 
with a 2 cross a 3
and then we want to dot that into a 1

434
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:39,470
我们看到分子和分母实际上是相同的，所以我们
and we see that the numerator and the
denominator are actually identical so we

435
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:46,300
只能得到2 pi，因为我们应该这样做，但是如果我们将B 1点到2 
just get 2 pi as we're supposed to
however if we took B 1 dotted into a 2

436
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:54,380
我们将得到相同的表达式，这里是一个2交叉，一个3向上，然后这个
we would get the same same expression
here a 2 cross a 3 up top and then this

437
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:59,420
楼下的整个表情我走的不对，然后点到一个2 
whole expression downstairs I'm not
going right and then dotted into a 2 and

438
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,850
那东西等于0，因为当您怀疑它与2交叉时，它与3正交
that thing equals 0 because a 2 cross a
3 is orthogonal to a 2 when you doubt it

439
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:11,600
变成2，你得到0，所以B 1 +点a 1确实给你2 pi B 1 a 2给你
into a 2 you get 0 so indeed the B 1 +
dot a 1 gives you 2 pi B 1 a 2 gives you

440
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:16,160
 0，您还可以检查它是否也适用于所有其他IJ组合
0 and you can check that it works for
all the other I J combinations as well

441
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,980
好吧，现在我们可以猜出倒数晶格矢量是什么
okay so now we have a guess for what our
reciprocal lattice vectors are so we

442
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:28,820
会猜测我们会将互易的晶格矢量G记为M 1 B 1 
would guess that we would write down our
reciprocal lattice vectors G as M 1 B 1

443
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:38,210
再加上M 2 B 2再加上M 3 B 3好吧，现在将是我们的客人，但是如果
plus M 2 B 2 plus M 3 B 3 ok that's
going to be our guest right now but if

444
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:46,280
我们想证明这些G是互易的晶格矢量
we wanted to try to prove that these G's
are reciprocal lattice vectors are we

445
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,640
想要如果要证明晶格中的G，我们需要证明的是
want if you want to prove the G's in
lattice what we need to show is that the

446
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,410
如果我只想选择一个点，那么m只能是整数
m's can only be integers okay now if I
want to just pick any point in

447
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:59,660
倒数空间我可以选择用M的任意点将该点写为G 
reciprocal space I can choose to write
that point as G with M's arbitrary so

448
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,990
让我以M的任意M开头，换言之，实数
let me start with M's arbitrary M this
arbitrary in other words real numbers

449
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:15,850
任意的，即允许考虑任何G考虑任何矢量任何矢量
arbitrary and that allows ie consider
any G consider any vector any vector

450
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:21,320
晶格，所以我将考虑从现在开始的任何可能的G，然后
lattice so I'm going to consider any
possible G to begin with now then what

451
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:25,010
我们要做的是强加定义eetu IG点R 
we're going to do is we're going to
impose the definition eetu the I G dot R

452
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:32,870
等于1，所以我们将其强制为1等于IG点R e ok 
equals 1 so we're going to force on it 1
equals e to the I G dot R ok what does

453
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:42,380
表示我对G的e是m1 v1加m2 B 2加M 3 B 3 
that mean e to the I okay G is m1 v1
plus m2 B 2 plus M 3 B 3 in but run out

454
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:51,120
在1加n 2 a 2加n 3 a 3的房间N 1 a上确定
of room N 1 a
on a 1 plus n 2 a 2 plus n 3 a 3 ok and

455
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:57,030
如果我要将条件e施加到IG r等于1，我也需要这个
I need this too if I'm going to impose
the condition e to the IG r equals 1 I

456
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:01,530
必须使用我们的条件强加这个东西等于1的条件
have to impose the condition that this
thing equals 1 well using our

457
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:07,860
正交条件B点a bi AJ等于2 pi Delta IJ，即1等于e 
orthogonality condition B dot a bi AJ
equals 2 pi Delta IJ that is 1 equals e

458
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:17,910
如果我想要2 pi IM 1 N 1加M 2和2加M 3和3 
to the 2 pi I M 1 N 1 plus M 2 and 2
plus M 3 and 3 now if I want this thing

459
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:23,100
对于每个可能的n的每个可能的直接晶格矢量等于1 
to equal 1 for every possible direct
lattice vector for every possible n the

460
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:33,000
只有这样，这才是正确的，这对于所有N的所有n都是正确的，并且仅当M为
only way this will be true this is true
for all n for all N and only if M are

461
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:42,570
整数EMAS是可以确定的整数，这意味着为了满足我们
integers EMAS are integers ok so that
means that in order to satisfy our

462
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:47,370
 IGR等于1的倒数晶格的定义是
definition of the reciprocal lattice
that e to the IGR equals 1 for all are

463
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,330
在直接晶格中，唯一可行的方法是选择
in the direct lattice the only way we
can do that is if we choose G of that

464
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,830
 MS整数的形式，因此G是晶格，我们不仅知道G 
form with the MS integers therefore G is
a lattice and not only do we know that G

465
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,130
是一个晶格我们知道它的原始晶格矢量是什么
is a lattice we know what its primitive
lattice vectors are so we just derived

466
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,930
到目前为止，G是具有原始格向量的格
the fact that G is a lattice with those
primitive lattice vectors so far so good

467
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:10,560
我对那好事感到满意，但实际上我认为这两个有趣的事实
happy with that ok good a couple of
interesting facts fact actually I think

468
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,710
这是一个家庭作业的问题，也许是关于家庭作业的修订等等
this is a homework problem maybe on the
revision of homework or something then

469
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:26,070
我们简单地添加一下，我们坐在FCC的平面是BCC BCC，反之亦然
we simply add we sit flat of FCC is BCC
BCC and vice versa kind of an

470
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:30,900
有趣的陈述，您可以检查一下，我想您可能会选择其中一项
interesting statement you can check it
and I think you probably will for one of

471
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:38,270
您的家庭作业中另一个有趣的注释是它旨在将D变成D 
your homeworks another interesting
comment is it's aimed that into D into D

472
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:47,640
适用相同的规则适用规则，但您可能想知道如何处理
same rules apply rules apply but you
might wonder how do you handle this

473
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:53,550
 2D中的公式，因为我只有两个向量，而不是三个向量
formula in 2d because I only have two
vectors not three well the way you do

474
00:40:53,550 --> 00:41:03,060
您处理公式只是选择a3等于Z hat 
you handle that formula is just choose
choose a3 equals Z hat a point coming

475
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,230
离开飞机，换句话说，如果您生活在2D模式中，您会想象有一个
out of the plane so in other words if
you live in 2d you imagine there's a

476
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:10,620
垂直于平面，您将其视为第三个原始晶格因子， 
normal to a plane and you treat that as
your third primitive lattice factor and

477
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:15,960
你从那里去，你生意很好，离我们还有几分钟
you go from there and you're in business
all right a couple of minutes left we're

478
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,690
在接下来的几堂课中我们将尝试做一些
going to try to in the next couple
lectures we're going to try to do some

479
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,140
对等格的解释和一些用途
interpretation and some uses of this
reciprocal lattice there's a rather

480
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:26,660
人们经常做出互惠格子的重要声明
important statement that people
frequently made the reciprocal lattice

481
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:38,280
是直接直接的傅立叶变换
is the Fourier transform Fourier
transform transform of direct direct

482
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,310
这也许不足为奇，因为倒易晶格存在于k空间中
this maybe isn't surprising because the
reciprocal lattice lives in k-space

483
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:48,180
而直接的格子生活在现实中是隔开的，你知道从我们这里得到
and the direct lattice lives in real are
spaced and you know to get from our

484
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,070
空间到K空间，您经常需要执行傅立叶变换等操作，但是
space to K space you frequently have to
do things like Fourier transform but let

485
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:58,140
我看看是否可以使此操作更加严格，让我们在1d中再次进行操作
me see if we can make this a little bit
more rigorous let's do it in 1d again so

486
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:03,630
我们的晶格向量是N等于N乘以N，我们如何去傅立叶
our lattice vectors are N equals a times
N and how are we going to Fourier

487
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:10,500
很好地变换那个格子，让我们做一个X的函数Rho 
transform that lattice well let's make a
function Rho of X which is a sum over

488
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:15,200
三角函数的所有晶格点在每个晶格点的位置
all lattice points of a delta function
at the position of each lattice point

489
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,450
好的，这就是所谓的增量函数
okay
this is what's known as a delta function

490
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:24,780
梳子Delta函数梳子您在量子力学中是否曾见过
comb Delta function comb have you seen
this before in some in quantum mechanics

491
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,360
或类似的梳子，看起来像是X轴，然后
or something comb okay it looks kind of
like this here's the x-axis and then

492
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:36,570
这是0这是2 a 3 a，它具有这些很大的Delta函数峰值
here's 0 here's a here's 2 a 3 a and it
has these great big Delta function peaks

493
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:44,430
在每个晶格点的位置上，可以尝试傅立叶
at the position of each of these lattice
points ok that's try Fourier

494
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:54,170
对其进行变换，以使X的Rho的傅立叶变换等于DX e到ikx 
transforming it so Fourier transform of
Rho of X equals integral DX e to the ikx

495
00:42:54,170 --> 00:43:00,060
然后我们有这个Rho X功能并插入X Rho功能
then we have this Rho of X function and
plug in the Rho of X function we'll pull

496
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:07,280
求和，这样就得到了N个积分DX e的和，即I KX和Delta 
out the sum so we get sum over N
integral DX e to the I KX and Delta

497
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,700
 X减去RN的函数，我们让Delta函数起作用，所以我们
function of X minus RN
and we let the Delta function act so we

498
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:22,730
对I k RN求和，我们也可以写为ne的求和
get some over n e to the I k RN which we
could also write as sum over n e to the

499
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,870
我Kaena好的，这是什么，我们有这个
I
Kaena okay so what is this we have this

500
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:32,750
 X的Rho的傅立叶变换，是所有这些阶段e至
Fourier transform of Rho of X and it's a
sum over all of these these phases e to

501
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:41,420
如果K是GM倒数晶格的元素，则IKr n好，则每个项
the IKr n well if K is an element of the
reciprocal lattice of GM then every term

502
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:47,840
这是IG n RN GM RN的e形式，因此每个项都是一个，因此
here is of the form e to the IG n RN G M
RN and so every term is one so this then

503
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,930
变成超过1的N的总和，如果有无限
becomes sum over N of the number 1 which
is infinite if you have an infinitely

504
00:43:53,930 --> 00:44:02,450
大系统如果K不是倒数晶格的元素，那么我们拥有
big system if K is not an element of the
reciprocal lattice then what we have

505
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:07,070
那么我们所拥有的就是您会遇到一个复杂的阶段
then what we have is you'll have a
situation where this complex phase here

506
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:11,570
不等于1，所以它有一些复数相和任意复数相， 
is not equal to 1 so it has some complex
phase some arbitrary complex phase and

507
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:16,700
那么，如果您到达的格子点是两倍大的double n，您将
then if you go out to a lattice point
which is twice as big double n you'll

508
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,430
得到两倍的复杂阶段，而您得到的结果却是原来的三倍
get twice the complex phase and you go
out to something as three times as big

509
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:22,520
您将获得复杂阶段的三倍，并且这些复杂阶段不断旋转
you'll get three times the complex phase
and these complex phases keep rotating

510
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:29,870
周围和周围，所以您会遇到一些振荡阶段
around and around and around so you get
some over oscillating phases which goes

511
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:35,600
归零，它们全部抵消，您得到零，所以最终可能是
to zero they all cancel out and you get
zero so at the end of the day it may be

512
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:44,260
我将移至此处，这就是它的傅立叶变换
I'll move over to here what we have
is it the Fourier transform of this

513
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:51,790
增量函数梳是所有可能的倒易晶格矢量K的总和
Delta function comb is a sum over all
possible reciprocal lattice vectors K

514
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,970
峰的负gm在倒数位置处的无限大峰
minus g-m of a peak an infinitely big
peak at the position of the reciprocal

515
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:01,690
晶格矢量，如果您仔细进行操作，则可获得2 pi的因数
lattice vector and if you do it
carefully you get a factor of 2 pi over

516
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:09,520
一个在外面a是这两个PI在a上的最后一个因素是相同的两个
a out out front a being the last factor
this two PI over a is it's the same two

517
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,460
当您进行傅立叶变换时显示的pi总是有两个PI 
pi that shows up whenever you do Fourier
transforms there's always two PI's

518
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,910
漂浮在周围，所以他们总是在那里，你可能不会被抓住
floating around so they're always there
you're not probably going to be held

519
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:21,130
我怀疑有责任获得正确的前置因子，所以
responsible for ever getting this
prefactor right I suspect so the

520
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:24,550
原理是，如果您在真实空间中拥有增量函数梳， 
principle is that if we have a delta
function comb in real space if you

521
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:28,000
通过傅立叶变换，如果您坐在一个
Fourier transform that the result is
infinite if you're sitting on a

522
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,050
倒数晶格位，如果您的K是倒数晶格矢量且它是0 
reciprocal lattice site if your K is a
reciprocal lattice vector and it's 0

523
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:35,080
否则，这将成为增量函数梳
otherwise
and that becomes a delta function comb

524
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:40,650
在k空间中，现在相同的事物或多或少都存在
in k space ok
now the same thing more or less holds in

525
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:52,470
三维在3d中执行此操作，因此在3d中的3d中，我们将X向量的Rho等于
three dimensions do this in 3d so in 3d
in 3d we'll write Rho of X vector equals

526
00:45:52,470 --> 00:46:00,160
如果您进行傅立叶运算，则将三角函数X的晶格点R的总和再减去R 
sum over lattice points R of a delta
function X minus R again if you Fourier

527
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,230
转换它，您将获得X Rho的转换，您可以使用Delta函数
transform it you'll get for a transform
of Rho of X you let the Delta function

528
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:10,119
起作用并播种一个三维Delta函数Delta 3，这成为求和
act and sow a three dimensional Delta
function Delta 3 this becomes sum over

529
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:19,690
 e到IK点R的晶格矢量R 
lattice vectors R of e to the I K dot R
and then this thing becomes exactly the

530
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:24,670
以同样的方式，如果K是倒数晶格矢量，它是一个
same way that if K is a reciprocal
lattice vector it's the sum over an

531
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,030
无限数量的晶格矢量是发散的数字1，您将获得
infinite number of lattice vectors are
the number 1 which diverges and you get

532
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,900
无穷大，如果K不是倒数晶格矢量，那么您就不会得到
infinity if K is not a reciprocal
lattice vector then you don't get the

533
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:35,260
数字1会得到一些复杂的相位，而这个复杂的相位会旋转并
number 1 you get some complex phase and
that complex phase rotates around and

534
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:40,480
我们将它们相加并得到0，所以最终得到2个PI立方体
around and around and we add them up and
get 0 so you end up getting 2 PI cubed

535
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,210
超过晶胞的体积，沸腾的晶胞又可能
over the volume of the unit cell the
boiling unit cell again you're probably

536
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:48,849
不负责任的因素
not going to be held responsible for the
prefactor

537
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:57,710
 k个倒数晶格向量G的倒数晶格向量之和
sum over reciprocal lattice vectors
of k- reciprocal lattice vector G okay

538
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:04,410
到目前为止，到目前为止，我们可以做得更好，甚至可以考虑
so far so good now we can do a little
better even we can consider things that

539
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,740
比起增量函数梳还要复杂，因为我们非常
are more complicated than just a delta
function comb because we're very

540
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,170
经常，我们实际上很少
frequently
we're very infrequently actually

541
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:15,510
呈现了真正的增量函数调用，因此我们将考虑
presented with a real delta function
call so instead we're going to consider

542
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:25,350
 X的任何周期函数和X的周期函数角色，我的意思是
any periodic function a periodic
function role of X and what I mean by

543
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:31,140
周期函数是X的Rho应等于X加R的Rho，其中R为
periodic function is that Rho of X
should equal Rho of X plus R where R is

544
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:37,320
向后平移一个晶格矢量，因此X的此函数Rho等于
a lattice vector lat
back so this function Rho of X equals

545
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,460
 X加上R的Rho，其中R是晶格矢量，它的周期为
Rho of X plus R where R is a lattice
vector it has the periodicity of the

546
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:45,720
点阵好吧，这样做有意义吗，好吧，好吧，现在让我们来研究傅立叶
lattice okay does that make sense yeah
okay okay so now let's take the Fourier

547
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:53,060
在X的Rho变换等于整数之前，此函数的变换
transform of this function before I
transform of Rho of X equals integral

548
00:47:53,060 --> 00:48:02,070
 d3x e到IK点X，这是X的所有空间Rho的积分
d3x e to the I K dot X and this is the
integral over all space Rho of X now

549
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,590
我们将做一些技巧，这将是一个有用的技巧
we're going to do a little bit of a
trick this is a useful trick that will

550
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,660
可能在某个时候回来困扰你，我将把这个积分
probably come back to haunt you at some
point I'm gonna take that integral over

551
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:15,090
所有空间，我将其写为所有晶格矢量的整数
all space and I'm gonna write it as an
integral over all lattice vectors are

552
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:22,200
那么单位晶格上的积分d 3x可能是较大的单位晶格
then the integral d 3x over the unit
cell maybe the bigger sites unit cell

553
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:27,270
周围都是周围，所以我只是在整个空间中分解该积分
around are around are so I'm just
breaking up that integral over all space

554
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:32,120
分为两部分，每个部分都在该位置周围的手指位点细胞上方
in two pieces each piece being over the
finger site cell around the position are

555
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:42,540
您的IK点X X的Rho，那么我们将定义一个参数Y x 
you the I K dot X Rho of X then what
we'll do is we'll define a parameter Y x

556
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:50,190
等于R加y，我们将把那个积分重写为整数
equals R plus y like that and we'll
rewrite that integral then as integral

557
00:48:50,190 --> 00:49:00,130
在单位单元的积分d 3y上求和
oops some over our sum over our integral
d 3y of over the unit cell

558
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:12,850
 e到IK点的数量，我猜是R加y，然后是R加y的Rho，现在是R加y的Rho 
of e to the I K dot I guess R plus y and
then Rho of R plus y now Rho of R plus y

559
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:17,860
 Rho是周期的，因此R加y的Rho与Y的Rho相同，因此
Rho is periodic so Rho of R plus y is
the same as Rho of Y so that makes that

560
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:24,550
容易，然后我可以从此处将e分解为IKr项，我得到
easy and then I can factor out the e to
the IKr term from this here and I get

561
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:34,780
将R e加到括号中的IK点R的乘积
sum over R e to the I K dot R put that
in parentheses times this in parentheses

562
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:48,190
现在，将这些元素在e的单位单元上的d 3y积分到y的rh的I点y。 
integral d 3y over the unit cell of e to
the I okay dot y of rho of y now these

563
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,840
第一个术语应该看起来很熟悉，因为我们刚才已经进行了计算
this first term should look familiar
since we just calculated a moment ago

564
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:57,760
这个东西是e到IKr的所有晶格向量的总和
this thing here is the sum over all
lattice vectors of e to the IKr

565
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,080
如果K为倒数晶格矢量，则为无限大，如果K不是倒数
if K is a reciprocal lattice vector this
is infinite if K is not a reciprocal

566
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,570
晶格向量，这个东西是0，所以这个东西就像我们在2 PI之前一样
lattice vector this thing is 0 so this
thing is just as we had before it's 2 PI

567
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:12,400
在所有倒易晶格向量上的单位像元总和的体积上求立方
cubed over the volume of the unit cell
sum over all reciprocal lattice vectors

568
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,730
我们的K减去G的Delta的G，所以它会给您一个在
G of Delta of our of K minus G so it
gives you a delta function peak at the

569
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:24,370
每个倒易晶格矢量的位置，在此被称为
position of each reciprocal lattice
vector this term here is known as the

570
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:29,670
 K的结构因子s 
structure factor s of K structure factor

571
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:36,640
结构因子，它只是我们所要函数的傅立叶变换
structure factor and it's just the
Fourier transform of the function we're

572
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,890
考虑在单个晶胞内，所以这实际上是一个相当有趣的
considering within a single unit cell so
this is actually a rather interesting

573
00:50:41,890 --> 00:50:45,400
声明和相当重要的声明，我们将在以后使用很多次
statement and rather important statement
we're going to use many times later on

574
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:49,210
您可以采用任何周期函数，只要您进行傅立叶变换就可以了
you take any periodic function
whatsoever you Fourier transform it it

575
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:54,310
在倒易晶格的位置将只有大约非零值
will only have about nonzero values at
the position of reciprocal lattice

576
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:59,020
向量及其在那些值上的保留典型格向量的权重为
vectors and its value at those preserves
typical lattice vectors is weighted by

577
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,770
在单个单位单元内对函数进行傅立叶变换
the Fourier transform of the function
within a single unit cell there's going

578
00:51:02,770 --> 00:51:06,100
在接下来的两三堂课中非常重要，所以我会见到你
to be extremely important in the next
two or three lectures so I will see you

579
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:10,180
在星期一，星期一，我想，我想，我会见你
on Monday Monday
I think Monday I think I'll see you

580
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:14,360
星期一好吧，周末愉快
Monday all right have a good weekend
you
