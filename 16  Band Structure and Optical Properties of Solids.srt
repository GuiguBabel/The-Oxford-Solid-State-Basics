1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:06,550
欢迎回来，现在是上届凝聚态课程的第16讲
welcome back it's now the 16th lecture
of the condensed matter course when last

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,169
我们不再讨论固体的能带结构，特别是
we left off we were talking about band
structure of solids and in particular we

3
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,589
正在考虑将近自由电子模型作为一种理解方法
were thinking about the nearly free
electron model as a way of understanding

4
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:19,660
乐队结构总结了我们学到的最重要的东西
the band structure a summary of the most
important things we learned is really

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:26,199
这张图片给出的这里，所以你有自由电子抛物线
given by this one picture here so you
have the free electron parabola and due

6
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,829
到周期性的潜能，您可以从布劳恩自身的边界散布到
to the periodic potential you can
scatter from Braun's own boundary to

7
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,700
 Burroughs自己的边界，您可以在Brauns自己的边界上打开一个空隙
Burroughs own boundary and you open up a
gap at the Brauns own boundary you can

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,560
如果您现在喜欢一件事，也可以在缩小区域方案中查看它
also view it in reduced zone scheme if
you prefer now one thing that's really

9
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,270
在这张图片中重要的是要意识到处于扩展状态的状态
important in this picture is to realize
that states that are in the extended

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:48,340
在第一个青铜器内部的区域方案状态被下推，而
zone scheme states that are inside the
first bronze own are pushed down whereas

11
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,930
第一个铜牌之外的州被推高，所以也许我会写
states that are outside the first bronze
own are pushed up so maybe I'll write

12
00:00:52,930 --> 00:01:03,720
通常在BZ边界内的状态
that generally States
inside inside BZ boundary BZ boundary

13
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:18,190
下推式推杆和外推式推杆，外推式推杆，离您越近
pushdown and outside are pushed up
outside pushed up and the closer you are

14
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,760
到边界上的青铜，您的能量从自由变为更多
to the bronze on boundary the more your
energy has changed from the free

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,690
电子模型，所以让我们看看是否可以采用此原理并了解
electron model so let's see if we can
take this principle and understand what

16
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,310
当我们使用更高的尺寸时，会发生在各种费米表面上
happens to various Fermi surfaces when
we go to higher dimensions so let's

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,790
考虑二维正方形格
consider two dimensions a square lattice

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,909
所以我们有一个正方形的青铜色自己的正方形熊，我会画一个正方形的青铜色自己的
so we have a square bronze own square
Bruins own I'll draw a square bronze own

19
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:49,390
这里是平方K等于零在中间这一点是PI 
here it is square K equals zero is in
the middle this point over here is PI

20
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:56,500
在拐角处的PI上方，让我们首先考虑一个电子的情况
over a PI over a at the corner and let's
consider first the case of one electron

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:03,340
每个晶胞，所以这意味着我们应该有一个一半充满青铜自己的一半
per unit cell so that means we should
have a one half filled bronze own half

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,229
充满路易斯的乐队或一半充满青铜的乐队，所以在
filled Louis band or a half filled
bronze own so what happens well in the

23
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:13,459
没有散​​射的潜力，你只有一个不错的费米圆环或费米
absence of scattering potential you just
have a nice Fermi Circle or Fermi

24
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,170
对我来说，在两个维度上都是长矛，我猜它是光盘
for me spear on two dimensions it's a
disc I guess and this is actually a

25
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:23,659
相当好地表示了许多具有一个的单价材料
fairly good representation of many mono
valent materials materials that have one

26
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:27,890
每个晶胞中的电子，例如钠，所以这里是二维
electron per unit cell for example
sodium so here's the 2 dimensional

27
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,349
模拟，您只有一块磁盘，正好填满青铜面积的一半
analog you just have a disk filling
exactly half of the area of the bronze

28
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,579
自己的，所以这个圈子应该恰好感觉到那个区域的一半
own so this circle is supposed to feel
exactly half of the area of of that

29
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:44,780
方形钠是一种BCC材料，因此它是青铜色的，是这种有趣的有线形状
square sodium is a BCC material so it's
bronze own is this funny wired shape

30
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,310
它是树干菱形十二面体或类似的形状，但是
it's a trunk rhombohedral dodecahedron
or some strange shape like that but

31
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,079
里面感觉正好是体积的一半是球形费米表面
inside it feeling exactly half of the
volume is a spherical Fermi surface

32
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:02,060
告诉我们钠几乎是一个自由电子系统，因为它是费米
which tells us that sodium is nearly a
free electron system because it's Fermi

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,400
现在，表面几乎是完美的球形当我们添加更强的表面时会发生什么
surface is almost perfectly spherical
now what happens when we add a stronger

34
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,629
周期性势，我们让周期性势开始移动
periodic potential where we let the
periodic potential start moving around

35
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:16,370
青铜器中某些州的能量本身很好
the energy of certain states in the
bronz own well what happens is the

36
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,879
在青铜自己的边界附近但青铜自己的边界内的状态得到
states near the bronze own boundary but
inside the bronze own boundary get

37
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,150
降低能量和最接近棕色区域的状态
pushed down in energy and the states
that are closest to the brown zone

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,150
边界被压得最大，所以如果您考虑这里的状态，这是
boundary get pushed down the most so if
you consider a state around here this is

39
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:32,930
非常接近青铜的边界，所以能量被降低了
pretty close to the bronze own boundary
so it's energy is getting pushed down

40
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,549
比这里的状态更多，其能量因此减少得更少
more than this state here whose energy
is getting pushed down less as a result

41
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:42,259
费米表面要变形，以至于周围有更多状态
the Fermi surface wants to deform in
such a way that more states around here

42
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:48,079
将要填充，所以它会像这样变形，使得更多的状态
are going to fill so it's gonna sort of
deform like this such that more states

43
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:51,290
靠近青铜器自身边界的地方正在填充，因为它们被进一步压低
near the bronze own boundary are filling
because they're getting pushed down more

44
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:54,109
在能量上比那些远离青铜本国边界的州
in energy than the states which are
farther from the bronze own boundary

45
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,180
在这里得到一个费米表面，看起来有点像这样
here so get a Fermi surface that kind of
looks a little bit more like this a

46
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,849
一点点的变形是由于
little bit deformed
due to the shifting around of the

47
00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,590
在青铜器中的国家的能量，实际上这就是我们
energies of the states in in the in the
bronze own and in fact that's what we

48
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,790
获得锂，锂又是单价材料，所以它是费米表面
get for lithium which is again a mono
valent material so it's Fermi surface

49
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:14,930
应该真的填满第一个青铜器本身一半的形状
should really fill half of the first
bronze own again the same shape of the

50
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,190
古铜色本身是一种BCC材料，您可以看到这里的2D模拟画了一点
bronze own is a BCC material and you can
see here's the 2d analog drawn a little

51
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,120
比我在板上画的要好，您可以看到发生了什么事
bit better than I drew on the board and
you can see that what's happened is

52
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,960
基本上是球形的费米表面接近于
where the Fermi surface which is
basically spherical comes close to the

53
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,660
青铜，被拉向青铜
bronze
it's pulled out towards the bronzong

54
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,750
边界，因为那些将接近棕色区域边界的状态具有
boundary because those states which will
close to the brown zone boundary have

55
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,560
比从青铜器走得更远的州，他们的能量下降得更多
been pushed down more in energy than the
states which are further from the bronze

56
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,060
自己的边界，如果周期性的
own boundary it's okay that makes sense
all right now in fact if the periodic

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,930
潜力变得非常强大，会发生什么事
potential becomes extremely strong what
can happen is the states right at the

58
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,230
青铜器自身的边界可以被压低到足以使它们降到费米之下
bronze own boundary can be pushed down
so much that they go below the Fermi

59
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,120
在这种情况下，费米表面会变形直到实际接触到
surface in which case the Fermi surface
deforms until it actually touches the

60
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,440
青铜色的边界，您会得到更像这样的东西
bronze own boundary and you get
something that looks more like this and

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,680
填充该形状内部的状态，填充该形状外部的状态
the states inside that shape are filled
and the states outside that shape are

62
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,180
空的，这正是材料铜也会发生的情况
empty and that's exactly what happens
with the material copper also a

63
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,560
一价材料实际上是FCC材料，所以它的形状是青铜
monovalent material is actually an FCC
material so the shape of it's a bronze

64
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,270
区域不同，这是我们之前看到的截头八面体形状
zone is different it's this a truncated
octahedral shape that we've seen before

65
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,890
您会看到哦，这是2D图片，比
and you can see that the oh here's the
picture in 2d which is drawn better than

66
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,420
我已经能够在板上绘制，您可以看到费米表面是
I've been able to drawn on the board you
can see that the Fermi surface is

67
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,430
基本球形，大致球形，但正好填满男爵的一半
basically spherical roughly spherical
but and fills exactly half of the barone

68
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,670
区域，因为它是单价的，每个单元电池一个电子应填充一半
zone because it's mono valent and one
electron per unit cell should fill half

69
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:37,310
第一个棕色区域的区域，但是球体靠近柏林区域的区域
of the first brown zone but where the
sphere comes close to the Berlin zone

70
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,060
边界靠近青铜区边界的状态的能量降低
boundary the states near the bronze zone
boundary get pushed down in energy and

71
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,540
与其他州相比，那些州优先填充
those states preferentially fill
compared to the other states which are

72
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,690
离柏林区域边界更远的地方，在这里被推动
farther from the Berlin zone boundary
which are over here which are pushed

73
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,620
下降得少，这些状态就变成空的，这样就清楚了
down less and those states become empty
so is that clear how the shape of the

74
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,650
费米表面正在变形，所以那是一个
Fermi surface is getting deformed all
right so that's an that's one

75
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:58,520
让我们考虑另一个有趣的情况，我们有两个
interesting case let's consider another
interesting case where we have two

76
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,180
每个晶胞的电子，所以这里每个晶胞又有两个电子
electrons per unit cell so here two
electrons per unit cell again we have

77
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,070
在没有铜的情况下，这里的青铜拥有者的K现在中间等于零
the bronze own here's K equals zero in
the middle now in the absence of a

78
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:14,810
周期性的电位，我们应该只将一个费米圆盘作为费米圆盘I 
periodic potential again we should just
have a Fermi Circle our Fermi disk I

79
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:21,650
猜猜它的体积与第一个青铜器本身的体积完全相同
guess whose volume is exactly the same
as the first bronze own so area in this

80
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:31,940
如果没有周期性电势，则情况与青铜拥有的VZ区域相同
case equals the same as bronze own VZ
area if there's no periodic potential

81
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,210
那当然青铜区也没关系没有时间看
then of course the bronze zone doesn't
doesn't matter there's no period to see

82
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,140
根本不需要注意青铜区，您将获得一个完美的
at all you don't have to pay attention
to bronze zone you just get a perfect a

83
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:43,110
完美圆如果周期性势很强，那么
perfect circle how
if the periodic potential is strong then

84
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,800
发生的情况是第一个青铜器内部的所有状态都被下推
what happens is all the states inside
the first bronze own are all pushed down

85
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,940
在能源方面，第一个铜牌之外的州的能源被推高， 
in energy the states outside the first
bronze own are pushed up in energy and

86
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,750
而不是拥有一个费米圆环，您将获得整个第一
instead of having a Fermi Circle what
you get is you fill the entire first

87
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,800
拥有自己的青铜器，并且清空整个第二个拥有的青铜器，您会得到一个满满的乐队
bronze own and you empty the entire
second bronze own you get a filled band

88
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,630
以及一个空白和一个空白带，空白被打开得如此之多，以至于所有州
and a gap and an empty band the gap
opens up so much that all the states in

89
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,200
第一个青铜器的所有权低于第二个青铜器的所有州
the first bronze own are lower than all
the states in the second bronze own you

90
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,100
得到一个填充带，一个间隙，一个空带，然后得到一个绝缘体，所以这些是
get a filled band a gap an empty band
and you get an insulator so these are

91
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,240
这两种可能性没有周期性的潜力，这是一个完美的循环
the two possibilities with no periodic
potential it's a perfect circle which

92
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,770
您可以查看是否愿意填充其中的第一个青铜器
you can view if you like as filling part
of the first bronze own that's inside

93
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:23,610
广场和第二个青铜器的一部分在广场外面，带有一个
the square and part of the second bronze
own that's outside of the square with a

94
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,370
强大的周期性潜力青铜器本身的一切能量都被压低
strong periodic potential everything in
the bronze own is pushed down in energy

95
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,720
所以所有的东西都填满了自己的第一个青铜色乐队，然后有一个空白
so everything fills in the first bronze
own filled band then there's a gap

96
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,169
第二个青铜器拥有的一切能量都被推高，因此存在差距
everything the second bronze own is
pushed up in energy so there's a gap

97
00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:39,180
在填充带和空带之间，所以我们有一个绝缘子
between the filled band and the empty
band and so we have an insulator okay so

98
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,900
那是它的最简单的部分，它所发生的更复杂的部分
that's the simple part of it the more
complicated part of it is what happens

99
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,060
当周期性势弱的势或您知道
when the potential where the periodic
potential is weak or you know

100
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,900
在这种情况下，中间中等强
intermediate intermediate ly strong in
that case what happens is it's some of

101
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,500
布里渊（Brillouin）第一区的州或能源消耗下降的地区
the states in the first Brillouin zone
or pushed down in energy and some of the

102
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
州和井，它们都被压低了，但是它们只被压低了
states and the well they're all pushed
down but they're only pushed down a

103
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,150
一点点，所以只有一些其他填充，所以那些是最低的
little bit so only some additional ones
fill so the ones that are sort of lowest

104
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,290
能量尚未充满其状态，因此这些状态将开始
in energy that haven't been filled their
states here so these states will start

105
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,350
除了已经填充的州之外，还包括其他一些州
to fill in addition to the states that
were already filled and some of these

106
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:14,130
除了已经填充的状态外，其他州也将开始填充
states will start to fill in addition to
the states that were already filled some

107
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,180
这些状态在这里等等，将开始填充角落， 
of these states up here and so forth and
will start filling in the corners that

108
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,300
我们还没有填写，但如果潜力不足够怎么办
we haven't filled in already but not
what if the potential isn't sufficiently

109
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,710
坚强，我们不会填写整个第一个青铜器，我们会留下几个
strong we won't fill in the entire first
bronze own we'll leave a couple of

110
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,409
角落里的状态是空的，他仍然是空的，仍然是空的， 
states in the corners which are empty he
are still empty still empty and the

111
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:37,559
这些角落里的状态仍然是空的
reason these states in the corners are
the ones that are still empty are

112
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,489
因为这些实际上是第一个中的最高动能状态

113
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,300
仅距离K最远的青铜等于零，因此应该是最后一个
bronze only the farthest from K equals
zero so those should be the last ones to

114
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,240
补充一下，因为它们具有最高的动能，所以必须
fill that because they have a highest
kinetic energy they would have to be

115
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,950
在它们进入费米表面以下之前，最大程度地向下推
pushed down the most before they go
below the Fermi surface similarly in the

116
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,300
第二名青铜器，所有州的能源都被推高
second bronze
all the states are pushed up in energy

117
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,339
保持充满的是那些动能最低的
the ones that remain filled are the ones
with the lowest kinetic energy these

118
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:06,410
小碎片在这里，其他所有人都倒空，但这些小碎片仍然存在
little slivers here everyone else
empties but these little slivers remains

119
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,209
填充好了，所以现在我有一张图片，它比我能画的更好
filled okay so now I have a picture of
it which is better drawn than I can draw

120
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,709
因此，看起来像这样的东西最早拥有的第一批青铜是
so it will look something like this that
the most of the first bronze own is

121
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:18,829
填满角落是空的，因为它们是最高的动能
filled the corners are empty because
those are the highest kinetic energy

122
00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,060
第一个青铜器拥有的州，第二个青铜器拥有的州大部分是空的，除了
states in the first bronze own most of
the second bronze own is empty except

123
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,720
这些小条仍保留填充，因为它们的动力学最低
these little slivers here which remain
fill because those are lowest kinetic

124
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,149
能量状态，因此最接近K的第二个青铜拥有量等于0，因此
energy states so the closest to K equals
0 in the second bronze own so the this

125
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:36,410
仍然是金属它仍然具有费米表面这是空的点
is still a metal it still has a Fermi
surface it's a point where the empty

126
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,790
州与青铜器内部的填充状态相遇，所以这里仍然是金属
states meet the filled States within the
bronze own so it's still a metal here

127
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,350
您现在可以进行低能量激发，通常的绘制方法是
you can have low energy excitations now
the way this is typically drawn is to

128
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,550
一次查看每个乐队，或一次查看每个贝林区。 
view each band one at a time or each
berlín zone one at a time so you just

129
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,420
画自己的第一个青铜器，你在这里有这张照片，大部分是
draw the first bronze own you have this
picture here it's mostly filled with

130
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:58,399
只是一些角落仍然空着，第二个青铜器很好，我们将其绘制
just some corners which remain empty and
the second bronze own well we draw it in

131
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,389
缩小区域方案，我们可以将所有内容转换回一个
reduced zone scheme we can sort of
translate everything back to within a

132
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:06,920
一块青铜，所以这件作品在这里被2 pi转换为在这里
single bronze own so this piece here
gets translated to over here by 2 pi

133
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:10,550
在这里的这件作品上，并通过2 pi转换到这里
over a this piece here and it's
translated to here by 2 pi over a this

134
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,910
这里的一块被翻译成下面这里的一块被翻译成上面
piece here is translated to down here
this piece here is translated to up

135
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,720
这是通常的缩小区域皮肤，您将所有内容移至
there this is the usual reduced zone
skin you move everything over until it's

136
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,300
都在一个单一的方肌区域内，而且只有这些小部分
all within a single square brawn zone
and it would be only these little

137
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,550
现在可以保留在第二个乐队或第二个青铜乐队中的口袋了
pockets that remain filled in the second
band or the second bronze own ok now

138
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,300
这看起来可能有点不自然，但实际上这正是发生在
this may look a little bit unnatural but
this is in fact exactly what happens in

139
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,019
例如，许多二价材料在每个晶胞中带有两个电子
many divalent materials with two
electrons per unit cell for example

140
00:10:36,019 --> 00:10:39,439
钙，看起来可能有点复杂，但让我一窥
calcium this may look a little
complicated but let me walk you through

141
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,129
这是第二波段中钙的实际费米表面，所以这是
it this is the actual Fermi surface of
calcium in the second band so here's the

142
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:48,050
这是一种FCC材料，所以它具有截短的八面体形状
it's an FCC material so it has this
truncated octahedral shape here's the

143
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:52,250
第二本青铜，以简化的石材图样书写，因此看起来完全像
second bronze own written in reduced
stone scheme so it looks exactly like

144
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:56,180
第一个青铜器自己，你可以看到发生了什么事， 
the first bronze own and you can see
that what's going on is there's just

145
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,550
这些仍然充满电子的黄色小区域
these little yellow regions where
electrons are still filled do you be

146
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:06,079
就像这些小东西偷偷进入第二区一样
there just like these little pieces here
peeking into the the second zone just

147
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,899
小小的帽子将仍然不是很
little little caps will
regions which still haven't quite been

148
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,480
清空后，这些碎片实际上是
emptied and these pieces are actually
the lowest kinetic energy points in the

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,140
像这里的这些铜牌一样，第二铜牌实际上是最低的动力学
second bronze own just like these pieces
here were actually the lowest kinetic

150
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,740
第二个青铜拥有的能量点最接近K等于零
energy points in the second bronze own
they were closest to K equals zero

151
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:26,060
他们处于这些阶段的中心，现在这张照片要难一些
they're in the center of these phases
now this picture is a little bit harder

152
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:31,040
进行解析，但要查看此处发生的情况透明的地方
to to parse but to see what's going on
here the places which are transparent

153
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,790
费米表面实际上碰到了熊自己边界的地方， 
are where the where the Fermi surface is
actually hit the Bruins own boundary and

154
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,720
那是没有画出来，所以这个大孔就是费米表面
then it's it's not drawn so this great
big hole here is where the Fermi surface

155
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,010
电子一直充满直到到达青铜边界
where the electrons fill all the way
until they hit the bronze own boundary

156
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,060
一直没有到青铜器边界的地方
and the places where it's not filled all
the way up to the bronze own boundaries

157
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,660
它被绘制为黄色的位置，所以您在这里看到的这些小角落类似于这些
where it's drawn yellow so you see these
little corners here similar to these

158
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,770
这些边沿的拐角处这些边是最远的点
corners here along these edges these
edges are the points which are farthest

159
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:03,080
在第一个青铜器中，从K等于零开始，因此如果K等于零，则
from K equals zero in the in the first
bronze own so if K equals zero is in the

160
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,850
中心最靠近的地方都被填满，就像这些被填满
center the places closest are all filled
up just like these are filled up all the

161
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,760
指向最远的青铜边界的方法是沿着这些点
way to the bronze own boundary that
points farthest are the points along

162
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,570
这些边缘，那就是它被涂成黄色的地方
these edges and that's where it's
painted in yellow where the brought

163
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,500
费米表面还没有碰到青铜的边界，让我画一个
where the Fermi surface has not yet hit
the bronze own boundary let me draw it a

164
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,839
那里有点大，实际上含钙，即使它
little bit bigger there there it is so
in fact with calcium even though it's

165
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,470
二价它每个晶胞有两个电子它实际上有两个两个能带
divalent it has two electrons per unit
cell it actually has two two bands which

166
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:34,250
被部分填充，第一条带被部分填充或大部分被填充
are partially filled the first band is
partially filled or mostly filled in the

167
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,940
第二个带子虽然大部分是空的，但里面仍然有几个电子，所以
second band although mostly empty still
has a couple of electrons in it so it's

168
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:42,160
实际上是金属的，所以这些都是很多的一般结构
actually metallic okay so these are sort
of the general structure of a lot of

169
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,050
乐队使用了许多材料，因此在本次演讲中
bands in in many many materials so for
the next for this lecture and for a

170
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,380
在接下来的几期讲座中，我们将大量讨论带理论
couple of the next lectures we're going
to talk an awful lot about band theory

171
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,470
以及带理论的后果以及可以推论的物理事物
and the ramifications of band theory and
the physical things that you can deduce

172
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,940
通过考虑带理论来讨论实际材料，并记住我们
about actual materials by thinking about
band theory and remember that what we're

173
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,320
在乐队理论中所做的是我们是否在为每个人都分配能量
doing in band theory is were we're
categorize giving energies to every

174
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,430
青铜器中的晶体波向量本身，我们知道这些晶体波向量
crystal wave vector in the bronz own and
we know that these crystal wave vectors

175
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,540
实际上对应于修改后的平面波或称为Bloch波
actually correspond to modified plane
waves or when a known as Bloch wave

176
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:16,160
在块定理中起作用，这是描述物理的一个很好的方法
functions in blocks theorem and this is
a very good way to describe the physics

177
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,000
这些材料中的许多都是根据这些修改后的平面波来思考的，但是
and many of these materials thinking in
terms of these modified plane waves but

178
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,650
确实应该警告我们
at
really we should be warned that there

179
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,540
是乐队理论的一些失败，我们现在就讨论其中一些
are some failures of band theory and
we'll discuss some of them now and just

180
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,650
简短地讲一下，然后在这个学期的最后两节课中
briefly and then sort of in the last
couple lectures of the term we'll come

181
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:38,380
返回并再次讨论其中的一些乐队理论，只是要知道这些
back and talk about some of them again
band theory just to be aware that these

182
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:46,050
乐队理论的主要失败之一是，尽管有时甚至很少
exist one major failure of band theory
is that sometimes although maybe rarely

183
00:13:46,050 --> 00:14:02,320
单价单价材料单价单元可以是绝缘体
mono valent mono valent materials valent
unit cells can be insulators and

184
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,410
根据乐队理论，这永远不会发生，因为如果你有单声道
according to band theory that should
never happen because if you have a mono

185
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:09,700
价或三价晶胞，如果每个电子中有奇数个电子
valent or a trivalent unit cell if you
ever have an odd number of electrons per

186
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,130
晶胞也许我应该说一般的奇价中的奇价是任何奇价
unit cell maybe I should say odd valent
in general odd valence any odd valent

187
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:20,290
一般来讲，在带理论中，单位电池可以是绝缘体
unit cell can be can be insulators in
general in band theory this should never

188
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,470
如果您有一个奇数的单位晶胞，您应该有一个部分充满
happen if you have an odd valent unit
cell you should have a partially filled

189
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,460
乐队，所以应该是金属的，所以我们必须问自己，我们离开了什么
band and so it should be metal so we
have to ask ourselves what did we leave

190
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:35,410
好了，我们遗漏的是电子之间的相互作用，为什么我的意思是
out well what we left out is interaction
between electrons interaction why i mean

191
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:45,660
为什么为什么因为我们忽略了而忽略了电子与电子的相互作用
why why because we left out we left out
out electron-electron interaction

192
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:53,410
电子电子互动如果这些互动很强大，它们可以使
electronic electronic interactions if
these are strong they can make the

193
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,310
即使算上电子，您也会认为绝缘子是绝缘子
material an insulator even though by
counting electrons you would think that

194
00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,090
这是一种金属，让我们尝试大致了解为什么会这样，想象一下您拥有
it's a metal let's try to understand
roughly why that is so imagine you have

195
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:07,060
一排这样排列的原子，并假设它是单价单原子
a bunch of atoms lined up in a row like
this and assume it's mono valent mono

196
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:14,590
价，所以它是每单位细胞一个电子，但假设相互作用非常
valent so it's one electron per unit
cell but suppose the interaction is very

197
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:22,260
强假设V库仑B库仑，非常强
strong suppose V Coulomb B Coulomb and
very strong strong

198
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,200
如果库仑的相互作用非常强烈，那么您可能会遇到这种情况
if the Coulomb interaction is extremely
strong then you might have a situation

199
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:36,000
其中一个原子上不应有两个电子一对一原子上一个原子
where there should be no two electrons
on one atom on one on one atom one atom

200
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,530
所以永远不要在一个原子上找到两个电子，因为库仑
so never should you find two electrons
on one atom because the Coulomb

201
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:45,360
相互作用会使该能量非常高且非常不利，因此
interaction would make that energy
extremely high and very unfavorable so

202
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,930
如果那是真的，那么你所需要的就是你所拥有的
if that's true
then what you have to have is you have

203
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:56,340
出现这样的情况，因为每个位置上都有一个电子就可以一个电子
to have a situation where as there's one
electron on every site okay one electron

204
00:15:56,340 --> 00:16:00,120
每个位置一个电子一个电子，那么你问这些
one electron one electron on every
single site then you ask can these

205
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,740
电子会四处移动吗？他们可以从一个位置跳到另一个位置吗？ 
electrons move around can they hop from
one site to the other well imagine this

206
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,310
试图用一些跳跃矩阵元素T跳到他的邻居肯尼的家伙
guy trying to hop with some hopping
matrix element T to his neighbor Kenny

207
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,280
跳到他的邻居，他不能，因为已经有人坐在那里
hop to his neighbor he can't because
there's someone already sitting there

208
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,850
库仑相互作用阻止您拥有两个电子
and the Coulomb interaction is
preventing you from having two electrons

209
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,480
在一个位置上，由于一个位置上有两个电子，因此具有高能量
on one site high energy from having two
electrons on one site because of the

210
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,970
库仑相互作用，因此您无法跳动，因此有时获得的收益是有效的
Coulomb interaction so you can't hop so
what you get is effectively sometimes

211
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:31,350
被称为电子交通阻塞，是电子的一种，通常被称为
called a traffic jam of electrons yeah
of electrons more frequently known as a

212
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:38,700
莫韦尔绝缘体是Nevel Mott的传统蝴蝶结获奖者，他描述了
Mott insulator after Nevel Mott a
traditional bow laureate who described

213
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,650
第一次，大概是为了得到Mott绝缘子
it for the first time and roughly in
order to get a Mott insulator you have

214
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:50,190
使库仑比跳跃和某种理解更强大
to have the Coulomb much stronger than
the hopping and sort of understanding

215
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,330
为什么还记得电子以形式声明方式跳跃的原因是
what why this is remember the reason
electrons hop in form claim ways is

216
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:58,260
因为他们可以通过散布波来降低动能
because they can lower their kinetic
energy by spreading out their wave

217
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,280
从一个站点到另一个站点的功能，这是通常的海森堡不确定性，如果
function from one site to another this
is the usual Heisenberg uncertainty if

218
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,480
您可以散布波动函数，您可以知道Delta X Delta P 
you can spread out your wave function
you can you know Delta X Delta P you can

219
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,099
降低Delta P，然后可以降低动能，但如果这样
make Delta P lower and then you can make
your kinetic energy lower but if the so

220
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,979
一旦电子由于其扩散而想要形成它

221
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:21,450
跳到多少能量会降低它在T上的能量
hopping how much does its energy it
lowers its energy about T if it hops

222
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,500
从一个站点到另一个站点（如果允许扩展其波动功能），但是
from one site to another if it's allowed
to spread out its wave wave function but

223
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,940
如果库仑相互作用比跳变强得多，则
if the Coulomb interaction is much much
stronger than the hopping then the

224
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,020
电子会很乐意牺牲它所获得的动能
electron would gladly sacrifice the
amount of kinetic energy it's gaining by

225
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,380
形成波浪以防止自身
forming a
plain wave in order to prevent itself

226
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,290
从坐在一个已经有另一个电子的地方开始
from ever sitting on a site where
there's already another electron in

227
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:44,490
在这种情况下，您将设置其中之一，这是一张非常经典的照片
which case you'll it will set up one of
these it's a very classical picture of

228
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,670
每个位置只有一个电子，你知道没有量子
just one electron sitting on each site
and you know there's no quantum

229
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,060
必须要考虑力学，它说每个位点都有一个电子， 
mechanics has to be considered at all it
says one electron in each site and it's

230
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,060
绝缘子，因为没有人能动，因为没人愿意坐在
an insulator because no one can move
because no one wants to sit on the

231
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,560
邻近站点，因为那里已经有电子，所以这种效应是
neighboring site because there's already
an electron there okay so this effect is

232
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,000
完全没有带理论，所以这是带理论的失败
completely left out of band theory and
so it's kind of a failure of band theory

233
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,470
在课程的最后，我们将再次进行分析
at the very end of the course we'll come
back and analyze this again a second

234
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:19,260
失败的乐队理论失败到失败的第二个原因是磁性
failure a band Theory failure to failure
number two is magnetism magnetism such

235
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,930
或许我会说我们尚未定义的铁磁
as or maybe I'll say Ferro magnetism
which we haven't defined yet materials

236
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:31,020
例如铁，其中自旋电子的数量大于
such as iron where the number of up spin
electrons is greater than the number of

237
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,630
电子向下旋转，或者她不等于电子向下旋转的次数
down spin electrons or maybe she's not
equal to the number of down spin

238
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,600
电子可以有不同数量的向上旋转和向下旋转
electrons you can have a different
number of up spin and down spin

239
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,270
电子即使在没有外部磁场的情况下也具有非零磁化强度
electrons a nonzero magnetization even
in the absence of external magnetic

240
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:48,620
即使当B等于零时
field even when even when B equals zero

241
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:57,450
外部等于零外部，这永远是不应该的
the external equals zero the external
and this is something that should never

242
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:02,370
发生在带理论中在带理论中，您应该同时填充向上的电子和
happen in band theory in band theory you
should fill up both the up electrons and

243
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:05,280
如果电子被充满，则下降的电子将具有相同的费米能
the down electrons to the same fermi
energy if they were filled up

244
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,300
不同地，您可以通过翻转总电子来节省能量， 
differently you could save energy by
flipping over sum up electrons and

245
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,990
将它们转变为电子，并平整两个费米表面
turning them into a Down electrons and
leveling out the two Fermi surfaces it

246
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,530
这样做可以节省您动能，原因是
would save you kinetic energy to do this
the reason this happens is something

247
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,650
我们将在课程结束时返回，这也是由于交互作用
we'll come back to at the end of the
course this is also due to interactions

248
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:29,820
相互作用加上量子力学再加上量子，这完全超出了
interactions plus quantum mechanics plus
quantum and it's totally outside of what

249
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:34,950
在传统频段理论的基础上，我们将只撤消平面波状态， 
will on of traditional band Theory we're
retreating only plane wave States and

250
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,870
向上电子和向下电子的能量应均匀地处理
energies of up electrons and down
electrons should be treated on even

251
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,200
立足好吧，这些就是我们应该放在脑后的事情
footing okay so these are things we
should just keep in the back of our head

252
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,290
乐队理论将失败的地方，但是对于大多数材料， 
the places where band theory is going to
fail okay but for most materials we're

253
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:51,260
考虑禁令理论是思考它的一种很好的方法，所以我们将
think about ban theory is a very good
way to think about it so we're going to

254
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,610
继续使用禁令理论，看看我们能了解多少
go ahead blazed on with ban theory and
see how much we can understand about

255
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:00,320
用这种乐队理论语言思考材料，所以我们要做的第一件事
materials by thinking in this band
theory language so the first thing we're

256
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,960
在禁令理论中会想到的是光学性质
gonna think about in ban theory is
optical properties optical properties of

257
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:22,010
固体和固体的结合带理论，所以首先我的意思是
solids solids and bound area by a band
theory so first of all what do I mean by

258
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,900
光学特性我指的是光学特性光学特性
by optical properties what I mean by
optical properties optical properties

259
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:38,260
表示什么波长的光什么是波长的光
means what wavelengths of light
what wavelengths of light light is

260
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:54,620
吸收或吸收
absorbed absorbed transmitted or
reflected transmitted or reflected in

261
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,980
换句话说，如果您将材料置于白光下，这通常是
other words if you put your material in
white light which is where we usually

262
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,480
说什么经常反射什么波长的光
put it what is what frequent what
wavelengths of light actually reflect

263
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,080
离开它，进入您的眼睛，给该材料提供您所需要的颜色
off of it and go into your eye and give
that material the color that you

264
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,660
实际看到是为了提醒自己关于可见光的几件事
actually see so to remind ourselves a
couple things about light light visible

265
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:20,360
您可能还记得的可见光范围是波长范围
light visible light
you might recall ranges from wavelengths

266
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:28,870
 749米，我们一直微红到大约400纳米
of 749 meters which we which is reddish
all the way up to about 400 nanometers

267
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,250
紫罗兰色，这就是您所能看到的或几乎所有人都能以任何速度看到的
which is violet and this is all you can
see or almost people can see at any rate

268
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,770
如果您考虑光子的能量，则约为1.7电子伏特
and if you think about energies of
photons this is about 1.7 electron volt

269
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:45,140
光子，这是大约3.1电子伏特的光子，介于红色和
photon and this is about 3.1 electron
volt photon and in between red and

270
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,700
紫色是整个彩虹光谱的红色橙色黄色绿色蓝色靛蓝紫色
violet is the whole rainbow spectrum red
orange yellow green blue indigo violet

271
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:56,330
现在让我们考虑一下平常的事情
the usual thing now let's think about
how it is that light is going to

272
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,610
通过一些禁令理论与我们互动这种类型的光将如何
interact with us with some solid
ban theory how this type of light will

273
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,980
与我们的材料相互作用，所以我们绘制了一些能带图，所以这是一个
interact with our material so we draw
some sort of band diagram so here's a

274
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,560
这是K我不会画整个棕色区域我只是要画草图
here's K I'm not going to draw the whole
brown zone I'm just gonna sort of sketch

275
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,960
一些您知道的图，它将朝所有方向和k空间移动， 
some you know diagram this will go off
and to all directions and k space and

276
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,750
也许像这样的图表好，所以这将是一个填充的填充价带，所以
maybe diagram like this okay so this
will be a filled filled valence band so

277
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:32,700
假设您在这里有一个价带，在价带中我们有一个缺口
imagine you have a filled valence band
here filled valence band we have a gap

278
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:41,370
间隙II是，然后我们有一个空导带
gap yeah II yep and then we have an
empty conduction band

279
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:55,960
也许我应该定义我通常所说的E间隙，所以egapp等于min 
maybe I should define what I mean by E
gap generally so egapp equals min

280
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:11,920
导带能量导带能量-最大--最大最大价
conduction band energy conduction band
energy - maximum - - max max valence

281
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:25,930
波段和能量所以这里的能量和这里的能量之间的差异
band and energy so difference between
this energy here and this energy here so

282
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:29,050
如果这是一个很大的差距，那是一个绝缘体，如果这是一个很小的差距
if this is a big gap it's an insulator
if it's small gap

283
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,700
这是一种半导体，化学势位于
it's a semiconductor the chemical
potential is somewhere in the middle of

284
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:40,150
差距，所以现在让我们问可见光将如何相互作用
the gap so when now let's ask how is it
that visible light is going to interact

285
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:46,930
我们的绝缘子在这里，一些光子会带有一些能量H bar Omega H 
with our insulator here well some photon
comes in with some energy H bar Omega H

286
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:52,780
欧米茄吧，如果光子能量大于间隙，那么它可以激发
bar Omega and if that photon energy is
bigger than the gap then it can excite

287
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:58,110
从填充价带到空导带的电子
an electron out of the filled valence
band up to the empty conduction band it

288
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:04,150
吸收电子，并且能量被之间的跃迁吸收
absorbs the electron and that energy is
taken up by the transition between the

289
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,570
低能量状态和高能量状态抱歉，他们说它吸收了
low energy state and the high energy
state sorry they say it absorbs the

290
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,400
电子吸收光子，并从中激发电子
electron absorbs the photon and the
electron it gets excited from

291
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,500
自行车从填充的价带跳到空导
the bike bike jumping up from the filled
valence band up to the empty conduction

292
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:29,010
乐队，这意味着汤绝缘子随后会出现绝缘子
band so what this means is that an
insulator in soup insulator ensue later

293
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:43,559
与egapp的间隙大于3.1的Evey是透明的，为什么那么透明
with gap egapp greater then 3.1 evey is
transparent why is that transparent well

294
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:49,210
如果间隙大于3.1 evey，那么任何光子都可以看到可见光
if the gap is greater than 3.1 evey then
any photon you can see any visible

295
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,890
光子没有能量将电子激发为
photon does not have the energy to
excite an electron to the valent from

296
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,750
价带到导带好，这是光子的关键
the valence band to the conduction band
okay that's the key point if the photon

297
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,789
没有足够的能量来激发两个频带之间的电子
doesn't have enough energy to excite the
electron between the two bands then

298
00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:07,120
基本上，光子根本不能与电子相互作用
basically the photon can't interaction
with the electrons at all the other

299
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,110
光子别无选择，只能完全穿过固体而没有
photon just has no choice but to just go
completely through the solid without

300
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,309
根本不进行交互，因为它无法进行这些转换，因此我们
interacting at all because it can't make
any of these transitions so these we

301
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,510
知道很多这样的材料，其中间隙大于3.1 
know plenty of materials like this where
the where the gap is greater than 3.1

302
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:24,880
令人羡慕，因此尽管它们看起来像透明的钻石石英窗玻璃
evie and therefore they look transparent
diamond quartz window glass although

303
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
这不是结晶氧化铝氮化镓，所有这些材料
it's not crystalline alumina gallium
nitride all these materials we which are

304
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,130
透明的，如果您有
transparent they have energy gaps
greater than 3.1 evie now if you have a

305
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:45,159
较小的带隙较小的间隙较小的egapp然后仅吸收光
smaller band gap smaller gaps smaller
egapp then light is absorbed only

306
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:57,399
光子只有H-bar Omega大于e间隙的光子才能被吸收
photons only photons with h-bar Omega
greater than e gap can be absorbed can

307
00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:05,950
被吸收，所以一些颜色被吸收，而一些颜色不被吸收， 
be absorbed so some colors are absorbed
and some colors are not absorbed and

308
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:10,419
这为许多材料提供了我们实际看到的颜色，因此
this gives many of the many materials
the colors that we actually see so let

309
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:15,460
我给你看几个例子，所以这里是你知道我们平时的事
me show you a couple examples so here is
down here is you know our our usual

310
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,399
彩虹，上面写着光子的能量1.7到2.6 
rainbow with the energies of the photons
written on them 1.7 evie up to 2.6 that

311
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:25,690
如果您看一下这种朱砂材料，我们得出的结果约为3.1 
we out here is about 3.1 evey if you
look at this material cinnabar it

312
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:31,480
硫化汞，它的间隙即将消失，这种材料看起来是红色的，因为
mercury sulfide it's gap is about to
evey and this material looks red because

313
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:38,680
除红色之外的所有其他频率红色的频率足够低
all all frequencies except for red red
has a low enough frequency that it

314
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:44,740
不能进行任何激发，因此材料是透明的
cannot make any of these excitation so
so that the the material is transparent

315
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,050
变为红色，其频率低于egapp，因此必须通过
to red it's frequency is lower than
egapp so it must go through whereas

316
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,160
其他频率只是被吸收，因此材料看起来是红色的，因为光
other frequencies are just absorbed so
the material looks red because the light

317
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,630
通过该材料是红色所有其他所有其他光
coming through that material is red all
the other all the other light

318
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:02,440
如果您看一下这种材料，频率已经被吸收了
frequencies have been absorbed if you
look at this material really are it has

319
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:09,370
间隙稍大2.4在这里一直很好，看起来有点
a slightly larger gap 2.4 evie well all
the way out here and it looks a little

320
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,850
多一点的橙色，因为红色的橙色，黄色的甚至是一些绿色的
bit more orange because the red orange
the yellow and even some of the green

321
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:16,870
通过材料和所有更高频率的蓝调和
gets through the material and all the
higher frequencies of blues and the

322
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,800
紫罗兰不会穿过吸收的物质，因此实际上结束了
violets do not get through the material
they get absorbed so this actually ends

323
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,520
看起来有点像橙色，现在您可能会说很好，为什么看起来不像
up looking kind of orange now you might
say well how come it doesn't look a

324
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,120
绿色比橙色稍微多一点，但是您有点复杂
little bit more green than orange but
it's a little bit more complicated you

325
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,870
必须对通过的所有这些颜色进行平均，以便
have to sort of average over over all
these colors that get through so the

326
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,020
这些可以穿透的颜色中间大约是橙色，然后
middle of these colors that get through
is somewhere around orange and plus then

327
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:38,470
可能还有其他影响，但大致原因是看起来是橙色
it can be some other effects going on
but roughly the reason this looks Orange

328
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:41,440
是因为蓝色和紫色被吸收了
is because the blues and the violets
have been absorbed and the colors that

329
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,550
实际上经历了没有激发和吸收
actually go through without making any
excitations and without getting absorbed

330
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,530
红人和橙子的硫含量差距更大
are the Reds and the oranges
similarly sulphur has an even larger gap

331
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:57,850
仍然是2.6 CV，现在将您看到的颜色推得更远了
still 2.6 CV and now the the color that
you see is pushed even farther out it

332
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:01,120
看起来更黄，因为res橙色是黄色，有些绿色和
looks more yellow because the res the
orange is yellow some of the greens and

333
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,170
甚至一点蓝调都通过了这种材料，所以有点
even a little bit of the Blues get
through that material and so it sort of

334
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:09,430
平均看来有点淡黄的紫罗兰还没有通过
on average looks kind of yellowish the
violets have not gotten through okay

335
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,410
他们已经被吸收了，所以这给许多材料以颜色
that they've been absorbed so this gives
many materials their colors this story

336
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,540
比我告诉你的要复杂一些，因为
is a little bit more complicated than
I've told you because the structure the

337
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:23,170
波段结构的实际细节对于强度有多重要
actual details of the band structure can
matter a lot as to how strongly

338
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:27,490
什么东西被吸收或未被吸收，最重要的问题，让我
something is absorbed or not absorbed
and the most important issue and let me

339
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:34,540
再次绘制这里是我要绘制随机带结构，所以这是一个填充
draw again here is I'm going to draw a
random band structure so here's a filled

340
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,110
价带的一部分，现在您可以进行传导
valence band part of a filled valence
band now you could have a conduction

341
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:43,029
乐队在这里看起来像这样
band here
it looks kind of like this like that and

342
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:49,309
因此，您可能会遇到一个可以过渡的情况
so you can have a situation where you
have a where you can make a transition

343
00:28:49,309 --> 00:28:53,960
从这里到这里针对不同的情况，这称为间接过渡
from here to here for different case
this is known as an indirect transition

344
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,960
或间接差距也许我会在这里写下定义，以便
or an indirect gap gap maybe I'll write
down the definition over here so an

345
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,960
间接差距或间接过渡间接差距等于
indirect gap or an indirect transition
indirect gap equals gap between

346
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:21,169
不同的情况，然后您可以像这样直接过渡
different case and then there you can
have a direct transition like this this

347
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:27,740
被称为直接间隙直接间隙我也在这里画了直接间隙
is a known as the direct gap direct gap
I've also drawn a direct gap over here

348
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:39,519
这是同一案例之间的差距直接差距等于同一案例之间的差距
which is a gap between the same case
direct gap equals gap between same case

349
00:29:41,649 --> 00:29:48,919
相同的情况，结果对于交互作用至关重要
same case and it turns out to matter a
whole lot where it's for its interaction

350
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,389
看看差距是直接的还是间接的，让我们思考为什么
with light whether the gap is direct or
indirect and let's think about why why

351
00:29:53,389 --> 00:30:01,309
很好，让我们回想一下，光的光频率是C乘以K，C是
this is well let's recall that light
frequency of light is C times K and C is

352
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:06,649
巨大的，我们之前就遇到过这个问题，所以如果我们想同时保护这两个问题
huge we've run into this problem before
so if we're trying to conserve both

353
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:12,919
通过吸收任何合理的光子来吸收光子的能量和动量
energy and momentum by absorbing a
photon the photons for any reasonable

354
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,409
频率不像任何光线频率的X射线频率
frequency that's not like x-ray
frequency for any light frequency if you

355
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:24,889
把光频率放在这里，k很小，所以当吸收光子时
put in a light frequency here k is tiny
okay so when when a photon is absorbed

356
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:29,539
如果您要保持动量，请选择电子基本上必须走
the elect if you're conserving momentum
the electron basically has to go

357
00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:35,570
如果光子不携带大量动量，它就不能直线上升
straight up it can't if the the photons
do not carry large amounts of momentum

358
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,440
因为光速如此之大，所以它们只带有很小的动量
they only carry tiny amounts of momentum
because the speed of light is so large

359
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,190
很明显吗？好的，谢谢
is that clear obvious yes okay good
thank you

360
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:46,850
谢谢你的回答，甚至应该给你一个巧克力，好吗
thank you for answering it should even
give you a chocolate for answering okay

361
00:30:46,850 --> 00:31:01,850
因此，我们所拥有的是直接直接的应用转换
so so what we have is that
direct direct app transitions have

362
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:12,350
强光吸收强光吸收而间接间隙
strong light absorption strong light
absorption whereas indirect gap

363
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:24,080
过渡间接过渡的吸收能力很弱，现在您可能
transitions indirect transitions are
very weak absorption now you might

364
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:33,230
想知道为什么吸收很弱，为什么我们间接吸收了全部吸收
wonder weak absorption why it is we get
any absorption at all with an indirect

365
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:38,360
差距过渡好吧，您可能会想出一些原因， 
gap transition okay there's a couple of
reasons you might think if you have to

366
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,049
如果您无法节省能量或动力，则可以节省能量和动力
conserve energy and momentum if you're
if you can't conserve energy or momentum

367
00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:45,350
根本没有吸收，但实际上有更复杂的方法
there should be no absorption at all but
in fact there's more complicated ways

368
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,899
例如，您可以在其中节省动量能量
where you can conserve energy of
momentum for example you can get one

369
00:31:50,899 --> 00:32:08,149
在光子中，光子进入一个电子激发，再加上一个声子激发，如果
photon in photon in goes to one electron
excited plus 1 phonon excited and if you

370
00:32:08,149 --> 00:32:12,710
这样做，那么电子的动量变化可以抵消电子的动量
do this then the momentum change of the
electron can cancel the momentum of the

371
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:15,980
声子，您的电子会单向关闭，声子会从
phonon you have the electron going off
one way and the phonon going off the

372
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,090
通过其他方式，您仍然可以节省能量和动力，但这是一个
other way and you can still conserve
both energy and momentum but this is a

373
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:24,139
流程要复杂得多，发生的情况比平常要少得多
much more complicated process and occurs
much more rarely than just the straight

374
00:32:24,139 --> 00:32:29,139
直接吸收间隙吸收弱的另一种方法是
direct gap absorption another way that
you can get a weak absorption is

375
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:37,970
不完美动量守恒K不守恒现在为什么
imperfect imperfect momentum
conservation K conservation now why is

376
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:44,750
您应该保存K只是不完美地记住原因
it that you should conserve K only
imperfectly remember that the reason

377
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,380
我们首先将这个晶体动量K保守起来
that we that K this crystal momentum is
conserved in the first place that all

378
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:53,029
守恒定律来自对称性，它迫使我们
conservation laws come from symmetries
and the symmetry that it forces us to

379
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:57,740
有K守恒是由晶格向量平移对称的，因此
have K conservation is translational
symmetry by a lattice vector so that

380
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:02,330
假设您拥有完美的晶体，那么在打印完美晶体K时
assumes that you have a perfect crystal
so in the printing a perfect crystal K

381
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,680
是绝对保守的，但是如果有障碍
is absolutely conserved but if there's
disorder

382
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:16,780
来自无序或杂质紊乱或来自无序的杂质，并且
is from from disorder or impurities
disorder or impurities from disorder and

383
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,840
杂质，那么K不再守恒，因为系统
impurities then K is not perfectly
conserved anymore because the system

384
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,380
不再是平移不变的，所以K将不是完美的
isn't translationally invariant anymore
so the K will be not perfectly

385
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,750
保守一点，您会通过间接间隙得到一定程度的吸收，因此
conservative you'll get some amount of
of absorption via the indirect gap so

386
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:35,500
实际的物理吸收量是能量的函数，所以此处的h-bar Omega 
the actual physical absorption as a
function of energy so h-bar Omega here

387
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:45,220
这里的吸收，这将是一个非常卡通，都像它上的卡通，但
here's absorption this is gonna be a
very cartoon all like cartoon on it but

388
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:49,390
当您到达间接频率（如果存在）时
when you get to the frequency which is
the indirect frequency if there is an

389
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:56,020
您知道间接转换频率可能是最低的
indirect transition frequency you know
it could be the case that the lowest

390
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,670
能量激励是直接的，在这种情况下，您知道这只是在您
energy excitation is direct in which
case you know this just occurs when you

391
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,240
当您达到那个频率或更高的频率时
when you get up to that up to that
frequency and at any higher frequency

392
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,500
您会得到这个加其他东西，但是如果间接这样的话
you'll get this plus plus other things
as well but if the indirect like that

393
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,139
如果间接间隙频率较低，请在此处显示
picture there if the indirect gap
frequency is lower

394
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:17,949
您将在间接频率弱时获得弱吸收，但是当您获得
you'll get weak absorption at the
indirect frequency weak but when you get

395
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:23,199
最高到直接间隙频率低于间接间隙的直接间隙频率
up to the direct gap frequency direct
gap frequency below the indirect gap

396
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:27,729
频率，您没有吸收，那么当您达到直接间隙频率时

397
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:33,460
当您超过此直接间隙频率时，您将获得强大的吸收能力
you get strong absorption when you get
above the this direct gap frequency okay

398
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:38,110
所以这有点像卡通，吸收是频率的函数
so this is sort of a cartoon the
absorption is a function of frequency

399
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,969
当存在间接差距和直接差距时，让我们来看一下
when there's an indirect gap and a
direct gap so let's actually look at

400
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,289
真实数据真实数据不是很好，但是您实际上可以看到

401
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:51,159
硅发生了一些间接的变化
little bit what's going on this is
silicon silicon has an indirect gap in a

402
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:54,669
间接频率小于直接频率的直接间隙

403
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:59,470
你会看到我像在那儿画画，随着你去，能量正在增加
you can see like I've drawn up there and
the energy is increasing as you go to

404
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,380
左侧，波长随着您向左移动而变小
the left the wavelength is getting
smaller as you go to the left and you

405
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,470
看到随着频率的改变，吸收实际上一直在增加
see that the absorption actually keeps
increasing as you change the frequency

406
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:09,370
但是当您达到间接差距时，现在会出现一些故障
but when you get to the indirect gap
there's a little bit of a glitch now

407
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:12,820
这看起来像是一个小故障，但这是对数图，所以如果您将其绘制出来
this looks like a small glitch but it's
a logarithmic plot so if you plot it

408
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,370
线性地，这实际上是一个相当大的一步
linearly it would actually be a fairly
big step

409
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:18,910
然后它，但它保持增长不断增加越来越多，但
then it but it keeps increasing
increasing increasing increasing but

410
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,069
那么当您达到上限频率时， 
then when you get to the
cap frequency there's a really big

411
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:26,019
再次出现故障，您知道从这里到这里的距离要少十倍，而您
glitch again you know this is more less
a factor of 10 from here to here and you

412
00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:30,009
知道，所以当您达到直接间隙频率时，您将迈出一大步
know so you get a big step when you get
to the direct gap frequency there's lots

413
00:35:30,009 --> 00:35:33,940
其他使您在其他任何地方都难以吸收的过程
of other processes that give you weak
absorption everywhere else more

414
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,720
涉及声子和凌空其他东西的复杂过程，所以它是
complicated processes involving phonons
and volleying other stuff too so it's

415
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,529
不像我在这里很形象地画出的那样简单，但至少您能
not quite as simple as I've drawn here
very figuratively but at least you get

416
00:35:41,529 --> 00:35:49,119
那两个物理的基本概念还可以，所以物理和
the general idea of the those two pieces
of physics okay so the physics and in

417
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,980
您可能已经在EMM课程中学习过一些金属的金属
metals you've studied metals a little
bit before probably in your EMM courses

418
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:02,619
他们显得有光泽和反光，他们害怕出现光泽和反光的原因
they appear shiny and reflective and the
reason they fear appear shiny and

419
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:09,130
反射性是因为它们具有高电导率和高电导率
reflective is because they have high
conductivity high conductivity and I

420
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,720
认为您可能是在电磁学课程中用金属研究的
think you probably studied this in your
electromagnetism course by metals

421
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,460
反映您是否这样做，是的，是的，希望是的，所以真的
reflect did you do that yes yes
hopefully yeah okay so really what

422
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:23,319
您要问的是电导率是Omega的函数，从中
you're asking about is the conductivity
as a function of Omega and from that you

423
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:32,440
可以得到光学特性光学特性，但再次您知道我们有
can get optical properties optical
properties but again you know we have if

424
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,420
让我画一下，这里有一些青铜，这是金属。 
let me draw you have some bronze on here
here's here's a metal metal is a

425
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,799
半填充带，所以我们现在可能会有这样的金属
half-filled band so we might have a
metal like this now the optical

426
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,990
高频的特性很大程度上取决于第二个频段的位置
properties that some high-frequency will
depend a lot on where the second band is

427
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:51,069
如果您可以过渡到第二个频段，从而改变的西格玛
if you can make transitions up to a
second band that will change Sigma of

428
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,400
欧米茄（Omega）即使在低频下也可能是很好的金属， 
Omega even though at low frequency this
thing may be a very good metal and the

429
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,789
如果您正在考虑电子，电子将非常自由地移动
electrons will move very freely if
you're thinking about the the

430
00:36:57,789 --> 00:37:01,390
高频下的电导率确实要担心
conductivity at high frequency you do
have to worry about whether the

431
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:05,259
过渡与带间过渡对齐，或者不与
transition lines up with an inter band
transition or it doesn't line up with an

432
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:08,470
带内过渡，无论是否可以进行这些过渡， 
intra band transition whether you can
make these transitions or not will

433
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,859
影响光学性能，实际上是详细的波段
affect the optical properties and it's
it's actually the detailed band

434
00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,609
使您知道铜看起来像铜或金，金和银的结构
structure that makes you know copper
look copper or gold with gold and silver

435
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:20,920
看起来与银色有关，可以在两个频段之间进行过渡
look silver it has to do with which
transitions can be made in between bands

436
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,400
在这些不同的材料中，现在不再赘述
in in those different materials won't go
into that in too much more detail now in

437
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,430
这些材料中的任何一个，认识到细节总是很重要的
any of these materials it's always
important to realize that details

438
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:37,599
光学性能问题实际上对许多事情都很重要，所以我会
a matter for optical properties actually
details matter for many things so I'll

439
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,530
只是写下细节很重要，所以是一般原则
just write that down
details matter um so a general principle

440
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:48,730
一个人住很重要的细节是当你看着一个表面时
to live by one one detail that matters a
lot is the surface when you look at a

441
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:52,990
看到材料的表面，并且经常看到表面
material you see the surface of the
material and very frequently the surface

442
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,440
由于某种原因，该材料的材料与其他材料不同，或者
of the material is not like the rest of
the material for some one reason or

443
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,990
另一个非常好的例子是钠这样的材料
another a really good example of that is
a material like sodium sodium is a

444
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,220
真的是很好的金属，但是如果您看一下它的表面，那是一大块钠
really good metal but if you look at its
surface here's a chunk of sodium and the

445
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,930
钠的表面看起来是灰色的，不能反射，为什么很好
surface of sodium looks kind of grey
it's not reflective why is that well

446
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,720
因为你实际上不是在看钠，而是在看氧化钠
because you're not actually looking at
sodium you're looking at sodium oxide

447
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,430
您将钠放在桌子上约一小时之内
you put the sodium out on the table
within about an hour the oxygen in the

448
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,970
空气侵蚀了钠的表面，形成氧化钠
air has attacked the surface of the
sodium is formed sodium oxide sodium

449
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:25,329
氧化物是绝缘体，所以您实际上看到的是绝缘层
oxide is an insulator so you're actually
seeing an insula a thin layer of

450
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,980
这张图的表面上的绝缘子钠已被切成两半打开
insulator on the surface in this picture
the sodium has been cut in half to open

451
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:34,930
在金属表面上，因此大约一个小时后，该表面看起来会变成金属
up a metallic surface and so for about
an hour that surface will look metallic

452
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,780
一个小时后，它将再次看起来很棒，因为您正在形成
and then after an hour it will look
great again because you're forming an

453
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:42,010
上面有一层氧化层，所以表面经常有很多东西
oxide layer on top of it so the surface
is matter an awful lot frequently the

454
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,520
表面不像其他材料
surfaces are not like the rest of the
material

455
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,140
另一个很重要的问题是杂质，我们将讨论
another thing that matters an awful lot
is impurities and we'll discuss

456
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,380
在下一堂课中也会有很多杂质，我将在本堂课结束时
impurities a lot in next lecture as well
I'm gonna be at the end of this lecture

457
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,690
如果有时间，但考虑到光学特性，可以想象我们还可以
if we have time but for the optical
properties let's imagine we have okay

458
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:06,940
这是一个空的导带空的导带，然后我们有
here's a empty conduction band empty
conduction band and then here we have

459
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:17,589
一些填充价带填充价带，这就是我们的
some filled valence band filled valence
band and that's what the the our

460
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:21,970
如果没有杂质，绝缘子或半导体看起来就像
insulator or semiconductor would look
like in the absence of impurities but if

461
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,740
我在材料中添加了一些外来杂质，它实际上可以添加本征态
I add some foreign impurities into the
material it can actually add eigenstates

462
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,130
在间隙中间的能量在
in the middle of the gap at energies
that are somewhere in the middle of the

463
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:35,849
间隙，所以这些是杂质本征态
gap so these are impurity eigenstates

464
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,790
鸡蛋由于杂质的存在而没有那些
eggs due to the presence of the
impurities in the absence of those

465
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:46,540
杂质如果间隙较大，该材料可能是透明的，但是当
impurities this material might be
transparent if it has a big gap but when

466
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,520
杂质就可以使一些
the impurities are
then you can make some a number of

467
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,660
某个频率的跃迁直至背面的杂质，这样您就可以获得
transitions of some frequency up to the
impurity in back so that you can get

468
00:39:53,660 --> 00:40:00,380
某些颜色某些颜色有点你知道修改
certain colors sort of certain colors
sort of a you know modifying the

469
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:04,520
您材料的透明度，因此即使数量很少， 
transparency of your of your material so
even with a weak very small number of

470
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:08,120
杂质会产生很大的不同，所以这是一个经典的例子
impurities this can make a huge
difference so here's a classic example

471
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,110
作为每个人都熟悉的材料钻石， 
as the material diamond that everyone's
familiar with it's the diamonds are a

472
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,790
女孩的最好的朋友，或者不是詹姆士·邦德电影或
girl's best friend or whatever the
phrases wasn't that James Bond movie or

473
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,460
无论如何，钻石永远是球队的蒙大拿州
something anyway diamonds are forever
what was the team's Montana in their

474
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:29,930
钱，所以对于钻石来说，纯钻石是完全清楚的，而如果您
money so so with diamonds pure diamond
is a is completely clear whereas if you

475
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,640
仅添加几个杂质这就是一千万硼杂质
add just a couple of impurities this is
one boron impurity for ten million

476
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,420
碳原子，使钻石有点蓝，这是一个相当著名的
carbon atoms and it turns the diamond
somewhat blue this is a rather famous

477
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,160
蓝色钻石，它是希望钻石的估计价值2.5亿美元
blue diamond it's the Hope Diamond
estimated value of 250 million dollars

478
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,670
它坐在华盛顿的史密森博物馆中
it's sitting in the Smithsonian Museum
in Washington it's also supposed to have

479
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:49,910
与之相关的诅咒，所以不要去尝试去窃取，这对你非常不利
a curse associated with it so don't go
try to steal it that's very bad for you

480
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:55,760
或者如果您每百万个碳原子增加一个氮原子
or something anyway if you if you add a
nitrogen atom per 1 million carbons it

481
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:03,230
使钻石变黄，这是蒂芙尼（Tiffany）钻石
turns the diamond a rather yellow color
this is the Tiffany diamond also highly

482
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,490
蒂芙尼公司拥有的贵重物品，我相信它在新店里
valuable owned by the Tiffany company
and I believe it's in their store in New

483
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:11,090
约克（York）的估计价值很好，现在可能已经超过1200万
York estimated value well it's probably
a lot more than 12 million now it's a

484
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:14,720
相当大的美丽钻石，它完全变成了钻石的颜色
rather large beautiful diamond and it's
coming entirely the color of the diamond

485
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:19,040
并不完全来自杂质，这些钻石实际上是
isn't coming entirely from impurities
now these these diamonds were actually

486
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,830
开采他们是从地雷里挖出来的，但实际上
mined they were done dug out of the
ground out of out of mines but in fact

487
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:30,170
现代人非常擅长于合成材料
in the modern era were very good at at
making materials synthetically in

488
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,260
实验室，您可以制造出完美无杂质的钻石
laboratories you can make a perfectly
good diamond with no impurities

489
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:37,040
无论您的实验室中有什么被称为合成钻石，它们都是
whatsoever in your laboratory there's
known as synthetic diamonds they're a

490
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,660
比从地下开采便宜得多，如果您希望它是蓝色的， 
lot cheaper than mining them out of the
ground and if you want it to be blue you

491
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,890
如果想要变成黄色，只需添加硼，如果想要，则添加氮气
just add boron if you want it to be
yellow you add nitrogen if you want to

492
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:48,770
可以是其他一些颜色您可以将其制成粉红色您可以将其制成
be some other colors you can you can
make it pink you can make it you make it

493
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,220
通过添加适当的杂质将其放入您想要的任何颜色
whatever color you want by adding the
appropriate impurities that put it in

494
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,330
正确的杂质本征，合成钻石的优点是
the right impurity eigenstates the
advantage of the synthetic diamonds are

495
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:01,010
好吧，它们更便宜，实际上它们更多，那里更少
well they're cheaper they're actually
more there have fewer

496
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,460
您可以设计杂质，可以将所需的任何杂质放入其中
you can design the impurities you can
put whatever impurity you want in it you

497
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:08,150
可以将杂质排除在外，因此它可以像您想要的那样纯净，事实上，如果您
can keep the impurities out so it can be
as pure as you want and in fact you if

498
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,470
您购买人造钻石不支持非洲的任何战争，因此，如果您
you buy synthetic diamonds you do not
support any wars in Africa so if you're

499
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,680
如果您打算购买钻石，请知道
out if you're planning on buying
diamonds you know please you know

500
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,840
他们有一些钻石行业希望您相信的
there's some how they the diamond
industry wants you to believe that

501
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,140
合成钻石在某种程度上不如天然钻石
somehow the synthetic diamonds are
inferior to the to the natural diamonds

502
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,840
从矿山挖出来完全是不对的，它是相同的碳
dug out of a mine it's totally not true
it's the same carbon

503
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,840
实际上，您在实验室中生长的碳可能比
in fact the carbon that you grow in your
lab is probably a lot purer than the

504
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,950
你从地雷里拉出来的东西，所以买人造钻石我
stuff you pull out of pull out of the
mines so so buy synthetic diamonds I

505
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:36,680
不拥有股票，并说它在钻石内部，但我没有完全披露
don't own stock and said it's inside of
diamonds but full disclosure I don't

506
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:45,890
好吧，让我们继续讨论一下一旦您
okay so let's go on and start talking
about what happens once you once you

507
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:50,870
在材料中激发电子，所以这里再次有能量
make excitations of electrons in
material so so again here's energy we'll

508
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:55,850
绘制一个顶部这里是价带顶部价带顶部
draw the top of a here's the top of the
valence band filled valence band top of

509
00:42:55,850 --> 00:43:02,570
价带价带已填充，并且我已绘制了扣除带的底部
valence band valence band filled and the
bottom of a deduction band I've drawn

510
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,770
这是直接的差距材料，但可能是间接的，并不是那么关键
this as a direct gap material but it
could be indirect it's not so so crucial

511
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:16,160
而且它仍然是空传导，所以在其中有一些能隙
and it's empty conduction anyway okay
and so there's some gap energy in

512
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,380
两者之间，如果我放入光子以激发电子
between the two and if I put in a photon
in order to excite an electron out of

513
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,130
从价带到导带I的导带然后得到
the conduction band out of the valence
band to the conduction band I then get a

514
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,230
电子在导带中上升，但是我没有电子下降
electron up here in the conduction band
but I get the absence of electron down

515
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:36,770
在价带中，有一个重要的名字
here in the valence band and that is an
important thing to have a name for which

516
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:44,710
被称为空穴，也是良好的电子不带电子的名称
is known as a hole also the name of a
good rock band absence of of electron

517
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:54,610
电子否则被填充
electron in otherwise wise filled

518
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:06,630
价带，所以当你把这种能量激发电子到
valence band so when you're putting this
energy to excite the electron up to the

519
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,220
导带可能是光子，也可能实际上是热能
conduction band it could be photon or it
could be actually thermal energy to can

520
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,819
如果间隙足够小，那么激发，那么您的温度就足够高了
excite if the gap is small enough so
then your temperature is high enough you

521
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:18,539
可以从价带到导带热激发电子
can thermally excited electron from the
valence band up to the conduction band

522
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:23,220
然后你要做的是实际上是在一个空穴对中产生了一个电子
then what you've done is you actually
pair created an electron in a hole

523
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,150
它完全类似于正电子类似拓扑类似
it's entirely analogous to a positron
analogous topology analogous analogous

524
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:37,230
正电子，我们在外层空间，你知道在外层空间的真空中，如果你
to positron we're in outer space you
know in the vacuum of outer space if you

525
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:41,240
放入足够高频率的光子，您可以配对创建一个
put in a high enough frequency photon
you could pair create an

526
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,069
您必须将两个MC平方能量放入电子-正电子对中
electron-positron pair you'd have to put
in the two MC squared energy the mass

527
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:51,450
电子和正电子的能量，您可以创建它们，并且需要一些时间
energy of the electron and the positron
you could create them and is some time

528
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:55,170
以后电子和正电子可以一起回到并pair灭
later the electron and the positron can
come back together and pair annihilation

529
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:01,289
发出一个光子是两个光子，可能是同一件事
emit a photon are two photons is a case
maybe it's the same thing here you have

530
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:07,230
放入间隙能量，然后配对产生一个电子和一个空穴，这些
to put in the gap energy and you pair
create an electron and a hole and these

531
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:10,799
事物在导带或价带中运行， 
things run around in the in the
conduction band or the valence band and

532
00:45:10,799 --> 00:45:15,240
过了一段时间之后，他们可以聚在一起并散发出能量， 
it's some time later they can come back
together and emit their energy and

533
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,779
光子或其他方式可以摆脱能量，它们来
photons or in some other way they can
get rid of their energy and they come

534
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:22,260
回来，他们走过八巷，所以完全类似于
back and they rien aisle eight so it's
entirely analogous to the idea of an

535
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:26,250
实际上，当狄拉克写下他的正电子理论时，电子正电子对
electron-positron pair in fact when
Dirac wrote down his theory of positrons

536
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:29,819
他非常了解半导体的发展，并且正在使用它
he was well aware of what was going on
in semiconductors and he was using this

537
00:45:29,819 --> 00:45:35,609
作为或多或少的正电子模型的模型，所以这是一种方法
as as more or less a model of the
picture of positrons so this is one way

538
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:39,750
你可以安排在价带或电子中得到空穴
you can have you can arrange to get
holes in the valence band or electrons

539
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:44,039
通过添加光能或
in the conduction band by adding energy
either either a light energy or or

540
00:45:44,039 --> 00:45:47,940
热能激发某人从价带进入传导
thermal energy to excite someone up from
the valence band into the conduction

541
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,940
带，还有另一种方法可以使价带和电子中出现空穴
band there's another way you could get
holes in your valence band and electrons

542
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,380
在您的导带中，使导带重叠，看看我是否画了
in your conduction band which is to get
the bands to overlap see if I've drawn

543
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,579
这个权利，所以如果这两个价带重叠一个
this right so here's my otherwise filled
valence band if the bands overlap by a

544
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:08,600
一点这里的EF，然后这些状态将被填充在价带中
little bit here's EF then these states
will be filled in the valence band

545
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,280
但价带顶部的状态将不满足并填充最低的
but the states on the top of the valence
band will unfill and fill the lowest

546
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,000
状态在导带中，这正是我们在
states in the conduction band and this
is exactly what we saw in the case of

547
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,160
今天早些时候的最低波段的钙还不够
calcium earlier today that the the
lowest band sort of is not quite filled

548
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,850
第二个频段才刚刚开始填充，所以这变得有点
and the second band is just starting to
fill and so this becomes a little bit

549
00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:32,640
金属的，因为您在价带中有一些空穴，并且在其中有一些电子
metallic because you have some holes in
the valence band and some electrons in

550
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,640
导带现在实际上是一些有用的Naaman粘土chur， 
the conduction band now actually some
useful Naaman clay chur which is the

551
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,150
系统中空穴的密度阱的密度可能是电子的密度
density of holes in a system density of
well maybe density of electrons

552
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:55,230
导带中的电子通常称为N和
electrons in conduction band in
conduction band is usually called N and

553
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,940
它被称为n实际上是因为它不是数字，而是负电荷
it's called n actually for it not for a
number but for negative charge and for

554
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,670
负是电子带负电荷，而空穴的密度
negative is the electrons have negative
charge whereas the density of holes

555
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:18,510
价带中空穴的密度等于通常带正电荷的PP 
density of holes in valence band equals
P P for positive charge that's the usual

556
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,910
 Naaman klaich ur以及我们是否在导带中产生电子
Naaman klaich ur and whether we create
our electrons in the conduction band in

557
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,870
通过添加这样的能量或通过重叠
our holes in our valence band by adding
energy like this or by overlapping the

558
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:32,100
乐队看起来像N等于P所以也许我们
band's like that
it appears that N equals P so maybe we

559
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,470
写下n通常等于P，因为它是
write that down
does n equal P generally because it's

560
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:41,730
每次我创建电子时，我都会创建一个洞，并在这张照片中
every time I created an electron I
created a hole and in that picture up

561
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:45,390
每当我将一个电子从一个带转移到另一个带时， 
there every time I transferred one
electron from one band to the other I

562
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,410
在导带中产生电子，在价带中产生空穴
created both electron in the conduction
band and a hole in the valence band so

563
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,810
看起来答案是肯定的，但是有点像合格的
it looks like the answer is yes but it's
going to be sort of a qualified yes yes

564
00:47:54,810 --> 00:48:14,099
如果是纯材料，否，否，我们有杂质，因此我们必须进行分类
if in pure material no
No we have impurities so we have to sort

565
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:18,390
考虑一下杂质如何改变这里的故事，所以让我们考虑
of think about how it is that impurities
change the story here so let's consider

566
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:25,619
世界上最重要的半导体硅是所有电子产品
the world's most important semiconductor
silicon silicon is what all electronics

567
00:48:25,619 --> 00:48:28,380
或多或少是由制成的，所以我将其绘制为方格
more or less are made out of so I'm
going to draw it as a square lattice

568
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:31,709
即使它不是正方形晶格，也有FCC晶格，但是
even though it's not a square lattice is
an FCC lattice with the basis but this

569
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:36,390
只是出于比喻的目的，在这里将它们绘制为方格
will just for figurative purposes will
draw it as a square lattice here these

570
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:41,249
都是硅原子，那么我们将想象一个硅原子
are all silicon atoms then we're going
to imagine taking one silicon atom and

571
00:48:41,249 --> 00:48:44,789
用另一个原子替换它我们将使用哪个原子
replacing it with another atom which
atom are we going to use we'll use

572
00:48:44,789 --> 00:48:47,130
元素周期表上硅旁边的东西
something right next to silicon on the
periodic table

573
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:52,349
你现在要摄取磷吗，所以我们将这个原子带入这里
will you take phosphorus now so we'll
take this atom here and make it into a

574
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:57,479
磷原子化石我要写出化石，以免与P混淆
phosphorus atom foss I'm gonna write out
foss so it doesn't get confused with P

575
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:03,569
不幸的是磷的符号是P，P也是符号
it's unfortunate that the symbol for
phosphorus is P and P is also the symbol

576
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:07,259
对于不相关的孔的密度，只是随机发生
for the density of holes that are
unrelated just sort of random happens to

577
00:49:07,259 --> 00:49:13,829
不方便，但是我们必须处理它，因此磷等于
be inconvenient but we have to deal with
it so phosphorus equals it's basically

578
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:20,099
它是硅原子加一个质子，在左边，在硅的右边
it's a silicon atom plus one proton it's
on the Left it's on the right of silicon

579
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:24,869
在周期表中加一个电子加一个电子，它有一些中子
in the periodic table plus one electron
plus one electron it has some neutrons

580
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:29,910
我们不太担心，所以我可以服用这种磷并查看它
to which we're not so concerned about so
I can take this phosphorus and view it

581
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:36,150
作为硅加上额外的正电荷加上一个额外的电子就可以了
as a silicon plus an additional positive
charge plus one additional electron okay

582
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:41,429
所以它在这里有一个额外的正电荷，那里有一个电子
so it has an additional positive charge
here and one electron sitting up there

583
00:49:41,429 --> 00:49:46,529
 1e现在坐在别处，那个电子会发生什么
1e sitting somewhere else now what
happens to that one electron this one

584
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:51,719
另外，也许我应该先谈一下质子，以便这个质子转
addition well maybe I should talk about
the proton first so this proton turns

585
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:56,009
并在下一堂课中证明这一点，您可以或多或少忽略
out and will justify this in the next
lecture you can more or less ignore the

586
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:59,640
那个质子的存在，只是将其视为硅核，是的
presence of that proton and just think
of it as a silicon nucleus yes it has a

587
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,689
收费，但收费并不重要，重要的是
charge but that charge is not so
important what's important is this

588
00:50:03,689 --> 00:50:08,309
电子在这里进行的很好，价带已经充满
electron here where does it go well the
valence band is already filled we

589
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:11,759
从硅开始，它有一个填充的价带纯硅有一个填充
started with silicon it had a filled
valence band pure silicon has a filled

590
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:16,019
价带和一个间隙，然后是一个空的导带，所以这个一个电子
valence band and a gap and then an empty
conduction band so this one electron

591
00:50:16,019 --> 00:50:23,910
必须进入传导浴，所以在这里
must go
into conduction bath so here we have

592
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:28,320
在导带中添加了一个电子，而没有在
added an electron into the conduction
band without adding a hole into the

593
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,310
价带我让我给你看一个更好的动画片
valence band let me let me show you a
better cartoon of this so in this

594
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:37,230
图片中的电子被绘制成围绕硅原子的小圆圈
picture the electrons are drawn as
little circles around the silicon atom

595
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:41,070
并且假设有两个电子彼此相邻的事实
and the fact that there are two
electrons next to each other is supposed

596
00:50:41,070 --> 00:50:46,410
描绘将其与硅原子结合在一起的共价键， 
to depict a covalent bond that holds it
to silicon atoms together the fact that

597
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,520
除了磷在哪里，所有电子都是
all you know everywhere except for where
the phosphorous is all the electrons are

598
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:55,710
绑在这些共价键上的另一种说法是，我们有一个
tied up in these covalent bonds is
another way of saying that we have a

599
00:50:55,710 --> 00:50:59,340
填充带占所有电子，并且存在一个缺口
filled band all the electrons are
accounted for and there's a gap to

600
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:03,840
现在将电子放到磷中时，将电子放到其他地方
putting the electrons anywhere else now
when you put it in the phosphorus the

601
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,320
磷可以形成四个相同的四个共价键，但其中有一个
phosphorus can make the four same four
covalent bonds but then there's one

602
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:12,030
剩下的电子，由于整个价带被填满
electron left over and since the entire
valence band is filled the only place

603
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,530
电子可以进入到导带中，所以这就是
that electron can go is up into the
conduction band okay so that's what

604
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:20,610
碰巧你可以用不同的掺杂剂做相同的游戏
happens you can do the same play the
same game you with a different dopant

605
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:25,800
让我们备份到硅另一侧的掺杂剂是铝，我们可以使用
let's back up to dopants on the other
side of silicon is aluminum we could use

606
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,320
铝铝是硅-一个质子，我们再也不用担心
aluminum aluminum which is silicon - one
proton and again we don't have to worry

607
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,340
关于质子太多，我们可以忽略这一点，这将证明以后忽略并
about the proton too much we can ignore
this will justify that later ignore and

608
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:41,430
那么它是负一电子，所以铝会丢失一个电子
then it's minus one electron so with
aluminium we're missing one electron

609
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:49,610
我们需要填充价带，所以这增加了一个整体，增加了一个整体
that we need to fill the valence band so
this adds a whole adds whole as a whole

610
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:58,260
实际上让我在这里画得很好，使用硼而不是铝硼是
and actually let me draw it okay here
that using boron not aluminum boron is

611
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:02,250
在元素周期表中铝的正上方，因此化学上
right above aluminum in the periodic
table so it's chemically exactly the

612
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:06,750
一样的故事硼是三价的，它可以使三价共价
same so it's the same story boron is
trivalent it can make three covalent

613
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:10,770
键，但是为了填充整个价带，缺少一个电子
bonds but there's one electron missing
in order to fill the entire valence band

614
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:16,950
所以我们缺少一个电子，让我只给出几个名词
so we're missing one electron let me
just give a couple terms of nominal

615
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:23,460
艾希尔对不起，我要结束了，所以磷被称为已知
Eicher I'm sorry I'm going over before
we end so phosphorus is known as a known

616
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:32,950
作为掺杂物，因为它会增加N姨妈
as a in dopant
because it adds an N aunt a negative

617
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:42,720
电荷或施主杂质或施主杂质，因为它提供电子
charge or a donor impurity or donor
impurity because it donates an electron

618
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:55,840
而铝或硼被称为P掺杂剂，因为它会增加一个孔或一个
whereas aluminum or boron is known as as
P dopant because it adds a hole or an

619
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:06,810
受主杂质，因为它接受或受主杂质SEP额外的电子
acceptor impurity because it accepts or
acceptor impurity SEPs an extra electron

620
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:14,830
也许我应该在结束之前定义open一词，所以dopant dopant是
and maybe I should define the word
opened before ending so dopant dopant is

621
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:25,920
泛指引入的外国化学品
a general word which means the a foreign
chemical foreign chemical introduced

622
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:35,310
引入纯净的化合物中
introduced into an otherwise pure to
otherwise pure compound otherwise pure

623
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:45,850
纯物质如此纯净的物质我想改变它的性质来改变
pure material so a pure substance I
guess to change its properties to change

624
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:55,270
如今，它的属性相当笼统
its properties rather general word
particular importance these days

625
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:00,370
考虑到奥运会正在进行中，所以我想我们会在那儿结束， 
considering the Olympics are going on
okay so I guess we'll end there and

626
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:04,210
明天我们会再次开始，抱歉
we'll start again tomorrow sorry for
going over

627
00:54:04,210 --> 00:54:10,159
 [掌声] 
[Applause]
