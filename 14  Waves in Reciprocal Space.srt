1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,150
欢迎回来，现在是浓缩物课程的第14讲或
welcome back it's now the 14th lecture
of the condensed matter course more or

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,719
少一点，我们结束谈论散射时，有一些
less we finished talking about
scattering there's a couple of little

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,259
零散的点点滴，我打算稍后再尝试
bits and pieces of scattering that I'm
going to try to pick up later maybe at

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,699
在其他一些讲座的结尾，我想继续讲下去，并使用我们所拥有的
the end of some other lectures instead
I'd like to move on and use what we've

5
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,510
当我们研究散射以便回头研究其他类型时学到的
learned when we studied scattering in
order to go back and study other types

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,289
晶体中的波浪类型我们最初感兴趣的波浪类型是
of waves in crystals the type of waves
we were interested in originally we're

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,880
电子波，振动波或声子，让我提醒您一些
electron waves and vibrational waves or
phonons so let me remind you a few

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,910
我们已经了解了一维关于电子波的东西，然后
things we had learned about electron
waves in one dimension and then we're

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,340
将尝试从我们所学到的知识中推广到更高的维度
gonna try to generalize up to higher
dimensions from what we've learned so

10
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:43,980
让我们回想一下电子的紧密结合模型
let's a recall the tight binding model
tight binding model for electrons

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,510
一维一维绑定模型，我们将考虑两个轨道的情况
binding model in 1d in 1d and we're
gonna consider the case of two orbitals

12
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:59,489
每个单位晶胞有两个轨道，或者如果每个单位晶胞有两个，则可以是两个
with two orbitals per unit cell or if
it's per unit cell and that can be two

13
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,229
原子在每个原子中一个轨道，也可以是同一原子上的两个轨道
atoms one orbital in each atom or it
could be two orbitals on the same atom

14
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,080
每个晶胞一个原子，我们可以绘制缩小区域中的色散
one atom per unit cell and we can we can
draw up the dispersion in reduced zone

15
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,570
方案这里是K这里是能量这里是PI超过这里的负PI超过了
scheme here's K here's energy here's PI
over a here's minus PI over a that's the

16
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:25,770
 Brauns拥有自己的BZ Ron区，我们可以这样写得出分散类型
Brauns own BZ Ron zone we can write draw
the dispersion kind of like this and

17
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:33,570
像在布劳恩斯自己的每个波矢K上的两种模式一样，否则我们可以展开
like this two modes at each wave vector
K in the Brauns own or we can unfold

18
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,750
扩展区域方案中的图片看起来像这样
that picture in the extended zone scheme
looking like this

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:51,960
这是K，这里是PI，而这里是负PI，而在a和两个PI 
here's K here's PI over a here's minus
PI over a there's two PI over a and

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,229
这是一个负两个pi，因此第一个模式的图片相同
here's minus two pi over a so we have
the same picture for the first mode and

21
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,460
然后在第二种模式下，我们将把东西移到
then for the second mode we're going to
shift things over shift the thing on the

22
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,630
在两个PI上向左或向右移动两个PI，使其看起来像这样，然后将
left or to the right by two PI over a to
make it look like this and ship the

23
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,540
在右边的两个PI上方的一块上，使其看起来像这样
piece on the right over by two PI over a
to the left to make it look like this

24
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,530
所以我们这里有所谓的第一个青铜拥有者
so we have what we called the first
bronze own here first bronze own BZ here

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,900
然后这些是我们的第二块青铜，第二块青铜
and then these pieces here we're the
second bronze own second bronze own BZ

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,329
所以有用的是K等于零
and so it's useful
there's K equals zero all right in the

27
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,620
中间，尝试将这个概念推广到三个维度是很有用的，或者
middle it's useful to try to generalize
this concept to three dimensions or

28
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,670
较大的尺寸，所以我们呃，一般来说， 
higher dimensions so let's uh let's do
that so generally the Bruins zone for

29
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,500
一个区域，因为我们正在考虑三维中的电子
one zone since we're thinking about
electrons in three dimensions is going

30
00:02:49,500 --> 00:03:01,500
总是定义为倒数空间中的晶胞，我们将拥有
to be always defined as the unit cell in
reciprocal space and we're going to have

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,310
弄清楚我们的意思是第一个青铜拥有第二个青铜拥有，等等
to figure out what we mean by first
bronze own second bronze own and so

32
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:15,209
因此，这是我们定义的将军和青铜器将军
forth so it's a general and bronze own
general general nth bronze own we define

33
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:25,639
如下，所以我们将从k空间中的第一个青铜点开始
as follows so we'll start with the first
bronze own points in k-space

34
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:40,019
越接近越接近越接近K等于零K 
that are closer to that are closer to
that are closer to K equals zero K

35
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,449
等于零，然后等于任何其他值
equals zero then to any other any other

36
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:59,940
倒数晶格点静止点R第一个青铜器是
reciprocal lattice point resit lat
point R the first bronze own are the

37
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:08,190
第一个青铜拥有第一个BZ，所以第一个青铜拥有的所有这些点都是
first bronze own first BZ so all these
points in the first bronze own are

38
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:14,579
靠近K点等于零然后靠近另一个倒易晶格
closer to the point at K equals zero
then to the other reciprocal lattice

39
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:17,909
点在这里是一个倒数晶格点，在这里的2减去2 pi 
points here's a reciprocal lattice point
here at two minus two pi over a here's

40
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:22,289
另一个互易晶格点在此处位于两个pi之上
another reciprocal lattice point here at
two pi over a and everything between

41
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,860
减去a的PI和a的PI构成第一个青铜
minus PI over a and PI over a
constitutes the first bronze own

42
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,129
它比其他倒数晶格点更接近K等于零
it's closer to K equals zero than it is
to any other reciprocal lattice point

43
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:33,659
您可能对这个定义有点陌生，因为实际上
this definition might look a little
familiar to you because in fact it's the

44
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:39,500
与大nur位点单元格的定义相同，因此等于Vig护士位点单元格
same definition as the big nur site cell
so this equals the Vig nurse site cell

45
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:48,569
在倒数晶格中，K的Seitz单元等于零，K的零点等于零
Seitz cell of the K equals zero point of
K equals zero in reciprocal lattice in

46
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:55,319
倒数格子听起来是否很熟悉，我希望所有观点
reciprocal lattice does that sound
familiar I hope all points they're

47
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,490
更接近给定的倒易晶格点，然后接近所有
closer to a given reciprocal lattice
point then to any all points that are

48
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,029
相比给定的晶格点更接近给定的晶格点
closer to a given lattice point than to
any other lattice point constitute its

49
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,659
 Vigna站点像元，因此所有比K更近的点等于零
Vigna site cell so all points that are
closer to K equals zero than to any

50
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:10,590
其他倒易晶格点构成了
other reciprocal lattice point
constitute the bigger sites cell of the

51
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,599
 K等于倒数空间中的零点是是好的怎么样
K equals zero point in reciprocal space
good yes okay good so how about the

52
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:28,379
第二个青铜拥有的点，其中K等于零是第二个最接近的点是第二个
second bronze own points where K equals
zero is the second closest is the second

53
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:44,449
最接近的里斯（如果该点是第二个青铜器，则是第二个） 
closest Reese if that point that point
are the second bronze own are the second

54
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:52,050
第二个是Z，例如，如果我们在此处选择一个点X，则将此点称为x 
second be Z so for example if we pick
pick a point here X call this point x

55
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,879
与此点X最接近的第一个倒数晶格点是第二个
the first closest reciprocal lattice
point to this point X is here the second

56
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,229
最接近点X的倒数晶格点K为零，因此
closest reciprocal lattice point to the
point X is K equals zero therefore this

57
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:06,990
 X点在第二个熊身上很好，这就是定义，所以
point X is in the second Bruins own good
okay that's the definition so a couple

58
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:17,550
关于这些定义的注释首先是青铜自己的边界二
of notes about these definitions first
of all one bronze own boundary two

59
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:28,529
相对的两个相对的相对的Z边界是倒数晶格向量
opposite two opposite opposite be Z
boundary is a reciprocal lattice vector

60
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:37,219
是他们up了一口的补给向量，让我们看看，所以这是一个青铜色的
is a resupply vector they sip lad
back let's see so here's a bronze own

61
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:40,969
边界是第二个青铜器上的第一个青铜器之间的边界- 
boundary it's the boundary between the
first bronze on the second bronze own -

62
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:44,659
在这是另一个PI上，PI是减去PI上调加PI的相反值
PI over a here's another one it's the
opposite one from minus PI raise plus PI

63
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:51,079
 R在它们之间的距离是两个PI，实际上是一个倒数晶格
R a distance between them is two PI over
a which is indeed a reciprocal lattice

64
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,429
向量类似，这是第二个青铜拥有者和外出者之间的边界
vector similarly here's a boundary
between the second bronze own and out

65
00:06:55,429 --> 00:06:59,329
这里实际上是第三个青铜器，所以这是青铜器的边界
here actually would be the third bronze
own and so it's a bronze own boundary

66
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:05,749
从那里到相对的青铜本国边界的距离
the distance from it to the opposite
bronze own boundary over here at plus

67
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:10,969
在a上的两个PI是在a上的四个PI，这也是一个倒数晶格矢量， 
two PI over a is four PI over a and that
is also a reciprocal lattice vector that

68
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:16,969
通常是一个真实的声明，好吧，有一个类似的例子
is generally a true statement okay
there's a similar so one a sort of Kavya

69
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:26,149
一个必然的结论是BZ边界或者也许不是
a corollary of this is that BZ
boundaries or maybe a maybe it's not

70
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:32,919
推论，但这些边界几乎是等价的陈述
corollary but it's almost equivalent
statement these e boundaries are points

71
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:43,029
其中K的绝对值等于某个G的K的绝对值加G的绝对值
where absolute value of K equals
absolute value of K plus G for some G

72
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:53,029
对于一些倒数晶格向量G好的，例如，您需要
for some reciprocal lattice vector G
okay so for example you need you need to

73
00:07:53,029 --> 00:08:00,349
让K和K加G让我们看看K和k k + g的大小相同
have K and K plus G let's see it was K
and k k+ g having the same magnitude for

74
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:03,679
 g的小猫是一些倒数晶格向量，所以如果减去pi 
kitten for g being some reciprocal
lattice vector so if you take minus pi

75
00:08:03,679 --> 00:08:08,209
在a上，您在8008上添加了倒数晶格矢量2pi，得到的是PI 
over a you add a reciprocal lattice
vector 2pi over 8008 you get plus PI

76
00:08:08,209 --> 00:08:11,239
那些具有相同的幅度，因此您处于柏林区域边界
over a those have the same magnitude so
you're on the Berlin zone boundary

77
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:16,069
类似地，您将负2 PI减去a，然后向其添加一个倒数晶格矢量4 
similarly you take minus 2 PI over a you
add a reciprocal lattice vector to it 4

78
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:20,059
您的PI等于2，加上2的PI的幅度相同，因此您的
PI over a you get 2 plus 2 PI over a
that has the same magnitude so your

79
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:25,639
荣誉棕色区域边界第二个对棕色很重要的声明
honor brown zone boundary the second
statement which is important about brown

80
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:35,808
区域是每个BZ*区域在三个区域中具有相同的面积或体积
zones is each BZ bran zone has the same
the same area or volume in three

81
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:43,478
尺寸相同的区域并代表
dimensions same area and and represents

82
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:52,300
代表每个K点每个晶体动量每个晶体波矢量I 
represents each K point each crystal
momentum each crystal wave vector I

83
00:08:52,300 --> 00:09:01,930
猜测波向量K曾经是构造青铜的总体思路
guess wave vector K once that was a
general idea of constructing the bronze

84
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,040
首先，它代表了每个物理上不同的波
own in the first place that every
physically different wave is represented

85
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,450
正好在青铜器中拥有一次，第二个青铜器拥有相当于
exactly once in the bronze own the
second bronze own is equivalent to the

86
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,839
第一个青铜器，我们只是将棋子以两种不同的方式移动
first bronze own we've just sort of
moved the pieces around in two different

87
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,790
放置，但每个波向量K在每个波向量内恰好代表一次
places but each wave vector K is
representing exactly once inside each

88
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,100
顺便说一句，从第二个青铜器本身可以明显看出您
bronze own incidentally is it obvious
from the second bronze own that you

89
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,510
可以定义第三个青铜像点，其中K等于
would define the third bronze own
analogously points where the K equals

90
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:32,589
零是第三最接近的倒数晶格点将是第三青铜
zero is the third closest reciprocal
lattice point would be the third bronze

91
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:35,850
是的，所以第一，第二，三等分可以拥有任意数量的青铜器
own so yeah the first second third you
can have as many bronze owns as you want

92
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,600
最后的最后声明很有用，我认为这是一项功课
the final the final statement which is
useful I think this is a homework

93
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,480
第三个作业的作业设置为K个州数K个州
assignment on the third homework set
that the number of K States number of K

94
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:55,959
在每个BZ中我们甚至在演讲中证明的状态BZ等于单位数
States we even proved this in lecture in
each B Z BZ equals the number of unit

95
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:05,440
听起来很熟悉，我们证明了这一点
cells unit cells in system in system
does that sound familiar we proved this

96
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,529
在一个方面，我认为对于功课，您应该在三个方面进行证明
in one dimension I think for homework
you're supposed to prove it in three

97
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:14,890
尺寸，这通常也是真实的陈述，因此实际上让我
dimensions it is also generally a true
statement so actually let me do an

98
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,730
二维的示例，以使其更清晰，因此我们将
example of this in two dimensions to
make this more clear so this we're gonna

99
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,630
从真实空间中的正方形晶格开始正方形的倒数晶格
start with a square lattice in real
space the reciprocal lattice of a square

100
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,630
格子也是正方形格子，所以我画了一个正方形，它应该是
lattice is also a square lattice so I've
drawn a square last it's supposed to be

101
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:29,410
作为倒数格子，所以又是方形格子
as the reciprocal lattice so it's a
square lattice again I've colored some

102
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,860
点的不同只是为了使他们易于谈论K点
of the points differently just to make
them easy to talk about the point at K

103
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,850
等于零，我在中间涂了黑色，所以首先我们要尝试
equals zero I've colored black in the
center and so first we're going to try

104
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,130
建造第一个青铜人，就是这种黑色的维尼亚·塞兹（Vigna Seitz）牢房
to construct the first bronze own that
is the Vigna Seitz cell of this black

105
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,490
指向中心，那么如何构造放置的手指Seitz细胞
point in the center so how do you
construct the finger Seitz cell you put

106
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,000
垂直平分线向下到最近的垂直平分线点
down perpendicular bisectors to the
nearest points perpendicular bisectors

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,480
到这里的红点，我们将这一点设为垂直平分线
to the red points here we'll make this
point that's a perpendicular bisector

108
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,520
在这里，这个平面这个垂直平分线这两个
here then this this plane this
perpendicular bisector these two also

109
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,790
将所有垂直平分线赋予红点和新点
giving all the perpendicular
bisectors to the red points and the new

110
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:06,550
该区域的颜色是第一个自己拥有的青铜色，现在的距离
color in the area that is the first
bronze own okay now the distance across

111
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:11,320
第一个青铜器本身是两个pi，这是一个倒数晶格向量
the first bronze own is two pi over a
which is a reciprocal lattice vector the

112
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,070
方式应该是它们与垂直等分线的距离， 
way it's supposed to be that distance
they are from perpendicular bisector and

113
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:20,410
垂直平分线是倒数晶格矢量，现在让我们寻找
perpendicular bisector is a reciprocal
lattice vector now let's look for the

114
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,730
自己拥有第二座青铜器，我们如何做到这一点，这是一套非常相似的结构
second bronze own how do we do that it's
a set very similar construction you just

115
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,020
开始放下更多垂直平分线，所以这里是第二个平分线
start putting down more perpendicular
bisectors so here the second closest

116
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,630
点集是这些蓝色点，所以我们放下垂直
sets of points are these blue points
here so let's put down perpendicular

117
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:36,400
像这样的人平分秋色这样的，所以这些是
bisectors to those like this like this
like this like this so these are the

118
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,180
垂直于蓝色的等分线，在这里我们将为
perpendicular bisectors to the blue
points out here we'll color in the

119
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,700
围墙蓝色区域，这是现在拥有的第二个青铜器，让我们检查一下
walled off area blue and this is now the
second bronze own now let's just check

120
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,360
如果您在第二个青铜像这里这样选择一个点，它就符合定义
that it fits the definition if you pick
a point like here in the second bronze

121
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:55,690
拥有第一个最接近的倒数晶格点是这里的红色点
own the first closest reciprocal lattice
point is this red point here the second

122
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,730
最接近的倒数晶格点为K等于0，因此此处为该点
closest reciprocal lattice point is K
equals 0 therefore this point here

123
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:06,850
这个蓝色区域中的某个地方是第二个青铜器，现在可以了
somewhere in this blue region is in the
second bronze own good okay now it may

124
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,080
显然，青铜器自身与男爵自身边界之间的距离
not be obvious that the distance across
the bronze own from barons own boundary

125
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,350
到柏林区域边界这是一个互易的晶格矢量，但我将展示
to Berlin zone boundary here is a
reciprocal lattice vector but I'll show

126
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,070
你是这是一个从0到蓝点的倒数晶格向量
you that it is this is a reciprocal
lattice vector from 0 to the blue point

127
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:23,230
如果你只是这样移动的话，那的确是与娇兰的距离
if you just shift it like that it's
indeed the distance across from Guerlain

128
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,010
区域边界到*区域边界，因此我们可以继续寻找
zone boundary to bran zone boundary so
we can keep going on looking for the

129
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,850
第三*区和建造第三*区，我们必须采取
third bran zone and to construct the
third bran zone we have to take put

130
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,770
垂直于这些绿点的等分线，所以我们要做的是
perpendicular bisectors to these green
points so let's do that put down those

131
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,410
垂直于等分线的绿线，我们
green lines which are perpendicular
bisectors to the green points and we

132
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,270
现在将区域填写为绿色，然后检查其是否满足定义要求
fill in the area now green and let's
check that it satisfies the definition

133
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,860
如果您在绿色区域中选择一个点，则倒数第二个倒数
if you pick a point here in the green
area the first closest reciprocal

134
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,700
晶格点是这个红色点，第二个第二点是蓝色点
lattice point is this red point here the
second closest is the blue point out

135
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,350
在这里，第三个最接近的是K等于中心的0点，所以它在
here the third closest is the K equals 0
point in the center so this is in the

136
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,020
现在，第三个*区域也是从*区域边界到*区域的距离
third bran zone now also the distance
from bran zone boundary to bran zone

137
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,610
整个系统的边界是a的4 pi，这也是一个倒易的晶格
boundary across the system is 4 pi over
a which is also a reciprocal lattice

138
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,300
向量现在，这些定义向您保证的另一件事是
vector now another thing that you've
been promised from these definitions is

139
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,620
每个*区域都有面积，就像那种威力和
that each bran zone has
area looks like the kind of might and

140
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:20,529
他们每个应该代表每个K点一次，所以青铜拥有
that they should each represent each K
point once so the bronze owns represent

141
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,149
每个可能的K点只有一次，看到我们要做的是
every possible K point exactly
once to see this what we're gonna do is

142
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,149
我们将用一些非常粗糙的方法来解决这个难题
we're going to take the pieces of this
puzzle and with some very crude

143
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,230
动画，我们将通过倒数晶格矢量移动它们，并显示
animation we're gonna move them by
reciprocal lattice vectors and show that

144
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,759
它们实际上是相同的形状，所以让我们看看它是如何工作的，我将采取
they're actually the same shape so let's
see how that works so I'm going to take

145
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:41,079
这个红色部分是第一个自己拥有的青铜色，我将获得完全相同的形状
this red section the first bronze own
I'm going to get that exact same shape

146
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,149
通过移动这些第一个
of the first bronze own same area same
shape exactly by moving these pieces of

147
00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:49,269
第二个青铜区，所以这件作品我将互惠互利
the second bronze zone over so this
piece I'm going to move by a reciprocal

148
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:54,459
像这样的两个pi的晶格矢量，然后我将移动
lattice vector like that two pi over a
over then I'll take this piece I'll move

149
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,420
通过这种方式将其传递给PI，然后我将最上面的部分移至另一部分
it to PI over a over this way and I'll
take the top piece move it to part over

150
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:03,490
一个下降，另一个下降到PI，然后完全填满第一个青铜
a down and the other one to PI over a up
and it fills exactly the first bronze

151
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,259
自己这么好吧，我的动画技能还不是很完美，请拭目以待
own so well okay mine animation skills
are not not perfect wait to see the

152
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:12,370
另一幅甚至更糟，但是嗯，但是您得到的图像应该充满
other one it's even worse but uh but you
get the picture that is supposed to fill

153
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:15,819
第一个布里渊区刚好一次，我们没有通过
the the first Brillouin zone exactly
once and we didn't by shifting things by

154
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:20,230
实际上，两个pi并没有改变波浪，因为如果您移动
two pi over a we actually didn't change
the waves at all because if you shift by

155
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:23,079
在两个PI上，您将获得完全相同的水晶动量
two PI over a you're getting back
exactly the same crystal momentum the

156
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:28,480
通过执行相同的物理波，因此第二个青铜器有效
same physical wave by doing this
so the second bronze own is effectively

157
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,319
完全等同于第一个青铜器现在让我们为
exactly equivalent to the first bronze
own now let's do the same thing for the

158
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,850
第三个青铜将以2 pi的价格将其运送过来，以3 PI的价格将其运送过来
third bronze own will ship this over by
two pi over a this over by three PI over

159
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,069
好的，现在真的可以了，但是您却知道
a okay now it's really gonna get that
but but you get the idea that it's

160
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,389
应该能够完美契合，如果我的动画效果更好
supposed to is supposed to fit perfectly
and had I been better with my animation

161
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:51,790
技能就可以了，所以这就是
skills it would have fit perfectly okay
so that's the general general idea of a

162
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:58,720
青铜器拥有3d中关于柏林区域的一些事实，因此在3d中有格子
bronze owns there's a couple facts about
Berlin zones in 3d so in 3d the lattices

163
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,509
我们有兴趣让我们写下我们所需要的晶格列表
that we're interested in let's write
down a list of the lattices we're

164
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,959
感兴趣的主要是感兴趣的，我们有简单立方简单立方我们
interested in are mainly interested in
and we have simple cubic simple cubic we

165
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:14,949
有BCC，而我们有FCC，所以对应的倒数格子是Lisa 
have BCC and we have FCC so the
corresponding reciprocal lattice is Lisa

166
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:21,250
平台很好，简单的立方晶格具有一个倒数晶格
plat is well the simple cubic lattice
has a has a reciprocal lattice which is

167
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:25,879
也简单的立方BCC晶格这是我的东西
also simple cubic
the BCC lattice this is something I

168
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:30,290
提到，我认为这是一个修正的作业问题，倒数格
mentioned and I think it's a revision
homework problem the reciprocal lattice

169
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:34,959
 BCC晶格的总和为FCC，FCC晶格的倒数晶格为
sum of BCC lattice is FCC and the
reciprocal lattice of an FCC lattice is

170
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:44,060
 BCC，所以第一个青铜的形状首先是BZ形状就很简单
BCC so the shape of the first bronze on
first being BZ shape is well for simple

171
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:49,550
立方晶格Figner位置单元是一个立方体，因此第一个青铜区
cubic lattice the figner site cell is a
cube so the first bronze zone for the

172
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,410
简单立方晶格是BCC晶格的立方，倒数晶格是
simple cubic lattice is a cube for the
BCC lattice the reciprocal lattice is

173
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:01,160
 FCC，所以我们得到的东西就是FCC更大的站点单元格的形状
FCC so we get something that's the shape
of the bigger site cell for FCC which

174
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,310
是一个有趣的形状，它是一个截短的八面体，我给你看一张照片
was a funny shape it was a truncated
octahedron and I'll show you a picture

175
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,800
在一秒钟内，对于FCC晶格，倒数晶格给出BCC，所以您
in a second and for FCC lattice the
reciprocal lattice gives BCC and so you

176
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:18,259
在这里得到BCC的大型nur网站单元格我也许会说这是
get the big nur site cell for BCC here
actually I maybe said this this one is

177
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:23,000
截断的八面体现在这是截短的八面体，这是
the truncated octahedron now this one is
the truncated octahedron and this is the

178
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,889
让我在幻灯片上展示一下好吧，所以这是FCC的第一个铜牌
let me just show it on the slide okay so
this is the first bronze own an FCC

179
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,279
格子这个是树干这个是截短的八面体这个是
lattice this one's the trunk this one's
a truncated octahedron this one's a the

180
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,040
截短的十二面体这是12尺寸这个有14面好
truncated no dodecahedron this one is 12
size this one has 14 sides alright

181
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:44,029
无论这些是青铜拥有的形状，在这种情况下， 
whatever these are the shapes of the of
the of the bronze own so in this case

182
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,309
 FCC晶格具有互惠晶格，即BCC，这是初学者
the FCC lattice has a reciprocal lattice
which is BCC and this is the beginner

183
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:54,079
 BCC晶格的Seitz单元，这是FCC的初学者Seitz单元
Seitz cell of the BCC lattice and this
is the beginner Seitz cell of the FCC

184
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,920
晶格也是BCC晶格的第一个青铜色，现在您会注意到
lattice which is also the first bronze
own of the BCC lattice now you'll notice

185
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:04,000
这些图片是在k空间KX KY和KZ中绘制的，您还会注意到
that these pictures are drawn in k-space
KX KY and KZ and you'll also notice that

186
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,539
这些图片上有一些字母，这些字母在那里
there are some letters dropped on to
these pictures these letters are there

187
00:17:08,539 --> 00:17:13,220
因为人们通常在描述棕熊身上的点时
because people typically when they
describe points on in the bruins own

188
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,659
他们通常说我们在谈论伽玛点或x点或L 
they usually say we're talking about the
gamma point or the x point or the L

189
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,650
点，那只是Naumann黏土的简写，您不需要
point and that's just a shorthand
Naumann clay chu that you don't need to

190
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,400
知道，但值得一提的是，当他们说X点时，他们拥有这些
know but it's worth knowing that they
have these when they say X point they

191
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,099
是指男爵区中的某个特定点，所以该点位于
mean some particular point in the barone
zone so the point in the middle of a

192
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,299
方形面称为X点此点此点此点
square face is called the X point this
point this point at this point the point

193
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,140
在一个六角形面的中间称为L点
in the middle of one of the hexagonal
faces is called the L point the point in

194
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,810
中心是你不需要知道的叫做伽马
the center is
it's called gamma you don't need to know

195
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:45,470
这些东西还可以，所以现在我们可以拥有这些图片
these things alright so now that we
we've can we have these pictures of the

196
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,390
您拥有的青铜，因为我们了解各种格子，我们可以开始考虑
bronze own for you know for our various
lattices we can start thinking about the

197
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,830
激发光谱电子激发光谱或声子
excitation spectra either the electronic
excitation spectra or the phonon

198
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,470
各种不同晶体的激发光谱，在青铜器中到处都有
excitation spectra for various different
crystals and so everywhere in the bronze

199
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,470
拥有的人会有所不同，例如您将拥有的缩小区域方案
own there will be different like in the
reduced zone scheme you'll have

200
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:09,110
青铜器中K的每个可能值都有不同的激励模式
different excitation modes at each
possible value of K in the in the bronze

201
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,150
自己做一个例子，就是这个情人节快乐的情人节
own so let's let's do an example being
this Valentine's Day happy Valentine's

202
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:21,350
所有人都可以，如果可以的话，我们要去做钻石
Day everyone is we're gonna do diamond
if alright so well we do diamond to

203
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,720
每年正好是今年的情人节，所以钻石
every year so just happens to be a
Valentine's Day this year so diamond do

204
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,830
回想一下，一个FCC晶格具有两个原子基，一个碳在零，零，零和
recall is an FCC lattice with a two atom
basis one carbon at zero zero zero and

205
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,480
每季度四分之一的碳，这就是
one carbon at one quarter one quarter
one quarter this is the shape of the

206
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,160
我们在上一张幻灯片中获得的青铜现在是第一个问题， 
bronze own as we had on the previous
slide now the first question and

207
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,340
机会赢取巧克力每个K应该有多少个声子模式
opportunities win chocolate how many
phonon modes should there be at each K

208
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:57,800
第一个青铜器中的向量拥有多少声子模式不，不，不，不，哦，天哪
vector in the first bronze own how many
phonon modes no no no no oh my god so

209
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,370
印刷品中有两个原子我要自己吃一个
there's there's two atoms in the print
I'm gonna eat this one myself

210
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:06,680
好吧，今年我要增加体重，原始中没有两个原子
alright I'm gonna gain weight this year
no there's two atoms in the primitive

211
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,390
每个原子可以在三个可能的方向上移动，这意味着您
unit cell each atom can move in three
possible directions so that means you

212
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,370
有六种模式，所以让我们看看是否有它的图片，所以这是
have six modes yeah so let's see if we
have a picture of it yeah so here's

213
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,070
这是钻石声子光谱的图片，因此绘制方式是
here's a picture of the diamond phonon
spectrum so the way it's drawn is that

214
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,400
您沿着特定方向在青铜区切开
you take cuts through the bronze zone
along certain directions that you're

215
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,960
对这个感兴趣，例如很多，所以这里是垂直频率，然后
interested in so for example this lot so
here's the frequency vertical and then

216
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,060
 K向量是水平的，但您在切割中给了您，所以这是切割
the K vector is horizontal but you this
given to you in a cut so this is cutting

217
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:39,740
从伽玛到X沿着1 0 0方向从伽玛到X沿着1 0 0 
from gamma to X along the 1 0 0
direction gamma to X along 1 0 0

218
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,340
沿着这条Duyvil线的方向，然后您会知道从这里到这里是
direction along this Duyvil line here
and then you know from here to here is

219
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,560
伽马沿1 1 1方向从L沿该虚线到此处
gamma to L along the 1 1 1 direction
from here to here along that dotted line

220
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,490
这个沿1 1 0方向稍微复杂一点的x2 Gama 
this one's a little more complicated
x2 Gama along the 1 1 0 direction so

221
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,830
实际上是从这个X穿过这个K到中间的间隙Gama 
that actually goes from this X through
this K into the gap Gama in the center

222
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,399
下一个*区域的上方，所以有些复杂，但是现在
of the next bran zone over so that one's
a little complicated but all right now

223
00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:05,639
您会注意到，如果您在此处选择一个中心点，您将
you'll notice that if you pick a point
in the center here you will count

224
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:11,369
正好有6种模式1 2 3 4 5 6如果您在这里计数，您会发现只有4种模式
exactly 6 modes 1 2 3 4 5 6 if you count
over here you'll discover there's only 4

225
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:15,350
模式为什么很好，原因是因为其中两个退化了
modes why is that well the reason is
because two of them are degenerate

226
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,379
您将在此处看到这两种模式，然后它们具有
you'll see these two modes coming in to
this point here and then they have the

227
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:23,279
从这里一直到这里一直有相同的能量，然后这里有两种模式
same energy all the way down from here
to here and then two modes here are

228
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,149
在这里退化，它们具有相同的能量或相同的频率
degenerate up here and they have the
same energy or same frequency all the

229
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,929
在这里，简并性的原因是因为您正在寻找
way over here and the reason for the
degeneracy is because you're looking

230
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:35,369
沿着特定的对称方向，在该方向上横向振动
along a particular symmetric direction
where vibrations transverse in this

231
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:38,129
方向和该方向上的横向振动看起来相同
direction and vibrations the transverse
in that direction look identical

232
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:42,899
而沿着这个方向是非常不对称的方向，所以所有方向
whereas along this direction it's a very
unsymmetric direction so all directions

233
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:46,470
振动实际上具有不同的能量，您可以看到
of vibration actually have different
energies you can see a couple

234
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,100
有趣的是，在此图中，伽玛点为K等于0， 
interesting things in this in this
figure the gamma point is K equals 0 you

235
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:56,340
可以看到下降到2 K的声模线性等于0，这些是
can see the acoustic modes coming down
to 2 K equals 0 linearly and these are

236
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,619
此处的光学模式处于高频状态，这些模式之一是
the optical modes up here at at high
frequency and one of these modes is

237
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:07,110
纵向两个是横向的现在我们可以问相同的问题
longitudinal two of them are transverse
now we can ask the same questions about

238
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,220
电子激发光谱，当您计算电子
an electronic excitation spectrum and
when you calculate an electronic

239
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:14,700
在这种激发光谱中，您必须确定类型绑定近似值
excitation spectrum in this a type
binding approximation you have to decide

240
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,460
您将要在每个原子上考虑多少轨道，因此
how many orbitals you're going to
consider on each on each atom so for

241
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:24,450
在上图中的示例中，我们考虑了每个晶胞两个轨道，因此
example in that picture up there we
considered two orbitals per unit cell so

242
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:31,080
考虑到典型的碳计算类型，您不想保留所有
given that a typical type of calculation
for carbon you don't want to keep all

243
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,919
轨道延伸到无穷大，所以通常您只需保持轨道
the orbitals out to infinity so
generally you just keep the orbitals

244
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,450
您对通常感兴趣的是什么轨道感兴趣
you're interested in what one is usually
interested in is the orbitals where

245
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:44,039
虽然有1到1 
there's some sort of interesting action
going on that though the 1 the 1

246
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,100
轨道有一个核心轨道，它们只是完全没有被填充
orbitals there was a core orbitals
they're just completely filled nothing

247
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,929
有趣的是，那里的三个3s 3p轨道等等
interesting going on there the orbitals
that are three 3s 3p and so forth those

248
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,840
完全是空的，完全没有意思
are just completely empty totally
uninteresting the ones that are

249
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,749
有趣的是有些是部分填充，部分是空白
interesting are the ones that are sort
of partially filled partially empty

250
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:02,340
这些是2s和3 2p轨道，因此考虑到3s 
those are the 2s and the 3 2p orbitals
so given that we're considering the 3s

251
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,960
和三个2p轨道有多少激发
and the
three 2p orbitals how many excitation

252
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:13,360
模式特征值应该在青铜器的每个K点处找到一次
modes eigenvalues should be find at each
K point in the bronz own one more chance

253
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:21,590
我们正在考虑每个原子有四个轨道，你说的答案是八，是的
we're considering four orbitals per atom
what was the answer eight you say yeah

254
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,270
好吧，哦，差不多他们到了八点，是的，所以有两个轨道
okay so Oh almost they got there all
right eight yeah so there's two orbitals

255
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:30,290
如果您算出您需要做的是，您需要算出
per if you count what you you need to do
is you need to count the total number of

256
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:33,590
每个基本晶胞的轨道，这将为您提供
orbitals per primitive unit cell and
that will give you the total number of

257
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:40,550
每个K向量的激励模式现在，此图为激励
excitation modes per per K vector now
this diagram this is an excitation

258
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:44,270
这些东西是钻石的电子激发光谱
spectrum an electronic excitation
spectrum of diamond these things are

259
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,240
由于其明显的原因，通常被称为意大利面条图，因为它看起来
frequently known as spaghetti diagrams
for obvious reasons because it looks

260
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,300
像一碗复杂的意大利面，你说不通
like some sort of complicated bowl of
spaghetti that you can't make any sense

261
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,360
的，但实际上是相当简单的
of but but it's actually it's it's
fairly simple

262
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,160
嗯，不是那么复杂，您正在查看削减的内容
well not that not that complicated
what's again you're looking at cuts

263
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,090
通过青铜器本身，所以这是L和伽玛点之间的一条线
through the bronze own so this is a line
between the L and gamma point along this

264
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:07,100
槽虚线，这是一条从伽玛到X的直线，沿着该虚线，然后是X 
slot dotted line this is a line from
gamma to X along this dotted line then X

265
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,510
到KK到伽玛，所以基本上只是削减铜牌
to KK to gamma so it's basically just
taking cuts to the bronze own and at

266
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:16,940
每个K点有八种模式一二三四五五六七八
each K point there are eight modes one
two three four five six seven eight and

267
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,950
有些方向看起来好像只有六个，让我们来看一下
some in some directions it looks like
there's only six let's see for example

268
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,760
这个方向一二三四有五六，因为其中两个已经成为
this direction one two three four five
six because two of them have become

269
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,420
退化在这里看到这两个一起走了哦，这两个来不挂
degenerate here see these two came
together oh no hang on these two came

270
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,350
一起在这里只做一个，因为实际上有两种模式
together here to make only one that's
because there's actually two modes with

271
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,720
同样的能量，所以您现在必须对此稍加注意
the same energy so you have to be a
little bit careful about that for now

272
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,690
碳的化合价为4，这意味着每个碳都贡献四个电子
carbon has a valence of four which means
each carbon donates four electrons and

273
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:49,250
这意味着我们已经捐赠了每个原始晶胞两个碳
that means with two carbons per
primitive unit cell we have donated

274
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:54,260
总共八个电子，所以您同时用两个自旋填充了底部四个带，因此
eight electrons total so you fill the
bottom four bands with both spins so the

275
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,050
当有间隙时，底部的四个带被填充
bottom four bands are filled when
there's a gap and you have the upper

276
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,130
四个乐队，事实上，正如我们稍后将在几个讲座中讨论的那样， 
four bands and in fact as we'll discuss
in a couple lectures later on that means

277
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:05,300
我们所拥有的是我们有一个非常好的绝缘子填充带，而不是一个很大的间隙
what we have is we have a really good
insulator filled bands than a big gap

278
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,420
然后是一堆空乐队，这也使钻石变得漂亮， 
and then a bunch of empty bands it's
also what makes diamond nice and

279
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,410
透明的，使钻石足够美丽
transparent so it makes diamond
beautiful appropriately enough for

280
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,860
情人节好吧，让我们从这里继续
Valentine's Day alright so let's move on
from here

281
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,470
认为今天的钻石足够了，所以其中之一是
think that's enough of diamond for today
so one of the things that's fairly

282
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,120
这个故事很重要，这是因为我们始终具有紧密的结合光谱
important about this is this story is it
with our tight binding spectra we always

283
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,720
的原则是，如果您将K乘以K加G，您就会准确地得到
have the principle that if you take K to
some K plus G you get back exactly the

284
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,720
同一波，您对振动也有相同的原理
same wave and you have the same
principle for vibrations as well now you

285
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,420
可能会问这个原理，是否当您将K倒数倒数
might ask whether this principle that if
when you shift K by a reciprocal lattice

286
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,590
向量是否对紧绑定逼近特别有用
vector whether that is actually special
to the tight binding approximation we

287
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:52,919
使用或是否实际上是一般性声明让我们提醒自己
use or whether this is actually a
general statement let's remind ourselves

288
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,620
为什么我们在紧密绑定模型的退出时找到了这个
why it is that we found this for an exit
for for tight binding model basically

289
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,790
紧密束缚波函数这与我的语言略有不同
the tight binding wave function this is
in a slightly different language than I

290
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:10,100
之前写过，但是您可以将它写为IK点R倍
wrote it before but you can you can
write it as e to the I K dot R times

291
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,600
坐在晶格点R上的电子，这是我们常称的东西
electron sitting on lattice point R this
is this is we used to call this thing

292
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,210
 Phi，我们给了这个，嗯，不，我觉得差不多，我想区别是
Phi and we gave this uh no I think it's
more or less I guess the difference is

293
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:23,760
现在我们在三个维度而不是一个维度中进行操作，这就是为什么
now we're doing in three dimensions
rather than one dimension that's why it

294
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,970
看起来有点不同，但这基本上是紧束缚波函数
looks a little different but this is
basically a tight binding wave function

295
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,000
我们之前写下的东西在取k 2k的情况下显然是不变的
that we wrote down before and this thing
is obviously invariant under taking k 2k

296
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,200
加g是因为当您将g按ET i移位k时，e会传给i gr 
plus g because e to the i okay oops
e to the i gr when you shift k by g ET i

297
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,950
 g点r等于1，因为g在倒数晶格中，而R在正晶格中
g dot r equals one because g is in the
reciprocal lattice and R's in the direct

298
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,980
晶格，因此，如果k偏移了g，则此处不会更改此因子，您
lattice so if k gets shifted by g it
doesn't change this factor here and you

299
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,880
回到同一波，所以你可能会问这是否仅仅是一个属性
get back the same wave so but you might
ask whether this is just a property of a

300
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,630
紧密绑定模型，或者如果这实际上是普遍的
tight binding model or if this is
actually something that's general and

301
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,929
这实际上是一个非常重要的问题，也是后来出现的一个问题
this is actually a really important
question and it's a question that came

302
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:02,520
在发现缩短方程后很短的时间内
up very shortly after the discovery of
the shortening equation shorting a

303
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,559
 1926年在1928年发现他的方程式，人们已经担心
discovered his equation in 1926 in 1928
that people were already worried about

304
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:13,650
这个问题，并由Felix Bloch著名地解决了， 
this issue and it was resolved very
famously by block Felix Bloch and what's

305
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:23,070
被称为布洛赫定理布洛赫定理好吧，这经常
known as Bloch's theorem Bloch's theorem
all right okay which is frequently

306
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,400
被称为所有材料科学的基础，这是基础
referred to as the underpinning of all
of material science it's an underpinning

307
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,529
在你所有的物理学中，这是非常重要的
of all of
your physics it's an extremely important

308
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:37,179
直到我们谈论一些
principle which may not seem so
important until we talk about some of

309
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,870
它的含义，但让我先陈述定理，然后我们将证明
its implications but let me state the
theorem first then we'll prove the

310
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:44,500
定理，然后我们将讨论其中的一些含义，因此该陈述是
theorem then we'll talk about some of
the implications so the statement is an

311
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:52,390
电子在周期电势中在周期电势中周期V 
electron in a periodic potential in
periodic potential potential periodic V

312
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:58,330
的RI猜测周期均值R的V等于VR加V等于R的大写R 
of R I guess periodic means V of R
equals V R plus V a capital R with

313
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:05,820
作为晶格矢量的大写R具有本征态形式的本征态
capital R being a lattice vector has
eigenstates of the form as I ghen states

314
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:22,360
形式很多符号在这里第二叹息R的子K等于e 
of the form a lot of symbols here for a
second sighs sub K of R equals e to the

315
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:39,720
 IK点R乘以u的u上标alpha sub sub K 
I K dot R times u superscript alpha sub
K of our where where u is periodic so

316
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:50,970
如果您将其从R移到U，则等于R的U加R和Cays， 
it's the same if you shift it from you U
of R equals U of R plus R and Cays and

317
00:27:50,970 --> 00:28:05,370
可以在第一个古铜色中选择k可以在第一个古铜色中选择
k's can be chosen in the first bronze
own can be chosen in first bronze own

318
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:13,149
换句话说，K是晶体动量K是晶体波矢量晶体波
in other words K is crystal momentum K
is crystal wave vector crystal wave

319
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,570
向量
vector

320
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:26,440
这种形式被称为这种叹气形式
this form is known as this form of sigh

321
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:36,860
叹气被称为修正平面波被称为修正平面
of sigh is known as a modified plane
wave is known as as a modified plane

322
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:49,550
挥动一个修改过的平面波修改一个应该相当平的平面波
wave a modified plane wave modified a
plane wave that that should be fairly

323
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:54,800
很明显，这是到IKr的平面波e，并乘以
obvious it's a plane wave e to the IKr
and is modified by being multiplied by a

324
00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:01,160
周期函数，你就是平面波指数的修改
periodic function you that's the
modification of the plane wave the index

325
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:12,140
 alpha alpha是乐队索引，乐队索引旨在描述您所知道的
alpha alpha is the band index and the
band index is meant to describe you know

326
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:15,950
如果您在这里谈论这一点，您将获得不同的波动函数，或者
you get a different wave function if
you're talking about this point here or

327
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,210
这一点在相同的K向量处，您可以知道相同的K向量
this point here at the same K vector at
the you know same K vector you can have

328
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:34,190
不止一个本征态，所以能量本征能量是
more than one eigenstate so the energies
eigenenergies are e superscript alpha of

329
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:44,030
 K所以e1和e2取决于我们在讨论哪个频段
K so e1 and e2 depending on which which
band we're talking about which which

330
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,450
最低的能量级别是下一个下一个最小值中的下一个最小值，因此
energy level the lowest are the next
lowest of the next next lowest and so

331
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:53,300
好的，这是我们在这里所做的一大堆声明，但是
forth okay so this is a pretty big bunch
of statements we've made here but it's

332
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:56,890
相当重要，因为它可以告诉您有关
fairly important because it tells you
about the general structure of

333
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,180
本征态处于周期性势，所以让我们首先证明这个定理，然后
eigenstates in a periodic potential so
let's first prove this theorem and then

334
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,630
我们将讨论为什么这个定理如此重要，为什么它如此重要
we'll talk about why this theorem is so
important and why it underlies so much

335
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:09,350
材料科学和半导体物理学等
of material science and semiconductor
physics and so forth

336
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,030
所以首先好吧，这是一个准证明，它实际上相当严格，但是
so first okay so this is sort of a quasi
proof it's actually fairly rigorous but

337
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,310
好吧，不会早点填写细节，但是准证明像这样
well will sooner not fill in the details
but the quasi proof goes like like this

338
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,440
首先我们考虑一下我们的哈密顿量
first we'll consider our Hamiltonian
which is H naught just the free electron

339
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,680
哈密​​顿量加上我们的势v是周期性的，所以V是周期性的
Hamiltonian plus our potential v which
is periodic so V is periodic

340
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:39,160
如果我们丢掉定期
and H naught is the usual P squared over
2m now if we threw away the periodic

341
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,670
我们会知道本征态的潜力，所以这些仅仅是平波本征态
potential we would know the eigenstate
so those are just plain wave eigenstates

342
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:51,970
打波，呃，他不好，好吧，我们不是，你知道k只是h的平方
playing waves uh he not ok ok we're anot
you know of k is just the h bar squared

343
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:59,560
 k超过2m的平方，我们通常到目前为止到目前为止，我们知道我们有飞机
k squared over 2m we usually have so so
far so good we know we have the plane

344
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,670
波浪，那么我们现在必须添加周期性电势
waves then we have to add the periodic
potential now what can the periodic

345
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:10,120
周期性的势能将您从一些K散布到一些K Prime 
potential do the periodic potential can
scatter you from some K to some K Prime

346
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:15,460
通过这种形式的矩阵元素，现在我们对这种矩阵元素了解很多
via a matrix element of this form now we
know a lot about matrix elements of this

347
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,620
从我们从散射理论中学到的东西形成这个矩阵
form from what we learned in scattering
theory this thing here this matrix

348
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:24,970
周期电势V从平面波k到平面波K prime的元素
element from a plane wave k to a plane
wave K prime via a periodic potential V

349
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:31,840
是u的傅立叶变换在K减去时求出的傅立叶变换
is the Fourier transform Fourier
transform of u are evaluated at K minus

350
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:43,270
 K素数，如果K减K素数K减K素数是，则其为0 
K Prime and that is the following it is
0 if K minus K prime K minus K prime is

351
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:51,720
不是倒数晶格向量不等于G，如果
not a reciprocal lattice vector is not
equal to G and we'll call it V sub G if

352
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:59,290
 K减去K素数等于G，我将其称为K素数减去K等于G，并且
K minus K prime equals G I'm gonna call
it K prime minus K equals G that and

353
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,540
这只是老挝的缓解条件，但您可以从波矢k散射到
this is just Lao ease condition but you
can scatter from a wave vector k to a

354
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,620
仅当K和K素数之差为a时，波矢量K素数
wave vector K prime only if the
difference between K and K prime is a

355
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:12,850
倒易晶格矢量，当我们研究x射线的散射时我们学到了这一点
reciprocal lattice vector we learned
this when we study scattering of x-rays

356
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:16,930
和中子等等，这几乎可以证明我们
and neutrons and so forth
so this gets us almost to the proof so

357
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:24,100
我们几乎可以在这里得出结论，为什么这里要点是
we can almost conclude the result here
why well the point here is that the

358
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,180
具有散射势的哈密顿量为块对角线无双点
Hamiltonian with the scattering
potential is block diagonal no pun

359
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,070
对角线块
intended
block diagonal block with a K diagonal

360
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:39,280
我的意思是，如果k和k，您可以从k分散到ak素数
what I mean by this is that you can
scatter from k to a k prime if k and k

361
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,600
素数被g隔开，然后从k素数可以分散到另一种情况
prime are separated by g and then from k
prime you can scatter to another case

362
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,799
如果双引号被一个G隔开，则可以分散到另一个K素
double prime if those are separated by a
G and you can scatter to another K Prime

363
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,130
依此类推，依此类推，等等，但是您永远无法改变水晶
and so forth and so on and so forth but
you can never change the crystal

364
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:56,289
动量，通过周期的散射可以得到的所有K 
momentum all of the K's that you can get
to by scattering by the via the periodic

365
00:32:56,289 --> 00:32:59,650
通过互逆的晶格矢量使它们彼此不同
potential all of them different from
each other by reciprocal lattice vectors

366
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:05,380
所以哈密尔顿分手了，如果你愿意的话，你进入这些领域
so the Hamiltonian breaks up and if you
into these sectors if you like and so

367
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:12,370
波动函数的形式必须为psy K，且必须为G的总和。 
the wave function must be of the form
psy K must be of the form sum over G of

368
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:22,330
一些系数我们称它们为mg加K乘以e到I k加G的点
some coefficients let's call them a mg
plus K times e to the I k plus G dotted

369
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,980
用r然后为什么它必须是这种形式，所以从e开始
with r then why should it have to be of
this form well you start with some e to

370
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,770
 IKr，然后将其混合成汉密尔顿量
the IKr and then you mix into that the
Hamiltonian mixes into that different

371
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:38,500
平面波，其波矢量K相差互相关矢量G和
plane waves whose wave vector K differs
by a reciprocal reliance vector G and

372
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,650
您可以根据需要将它们混合使用，它们都会得到一些系数
you can mix in as many of those as you
want and they all get some coefficients

373
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,669
但是到了最后，波动函数必须仅是事物的诗篇
a but at the end of the day the wave
function must be a psalm only of things

374
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:49,360
具有相同的晶体动量k加上一些倒易的晶格矢量g 
that have the same crystal momentum k
plus some reciprocal lattice vector g

375
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,780
没有办法比较耳部潜力可以改变您的
there's no way that compare otic
potential can take you can change your

376
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,280
水晶气势是重要的认识
crystal momentum that's the important
realization good yeah

377
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:02,740
好的，好吧，所以从这里我们已经完成了很多，因为你可以
happy good all right so from here we're
pretty much done because you can just

378
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:11,710
将e分解为IK点R，然后在G Plus K中有超过G的部分
factor out the e to the I K dot R and
then you have some over G of a G Plus K

379
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:26,710
 e到i gr，这是r的周期函数uu 
e to the i gr and this piece here is the
is the periodic function u u of r which

380
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:32,100
而且您可以说这件事一定是周期性的，因为如果您将e转到i 
and you can tell this thing must be
periodic because if you take e to the i

381
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:41,320
用r加r点缀的gg通过直接空间晶格矢量移动它
g g dotted with r plus r move it by a
direct space lattice vector this thing

382
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:47,669
与e到点R相同，所以这是周期性的
is the same as e to the i okay dot R so
this thing is periodic

383
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:57,420
如所声称的还可以，我们还可以检查如果您服用K而您会发生什么
as claimed okay furthermore we can also
check what happens if you take K and you

384
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,070
将其移动一个互逆的晶格矢量G，所以让我们实际采用这种形式
shift it by a reciprocal lattice vector
G so let's let's actually take this form

385
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:09,330
的K到这里，让我们将K加G的正弦值，实际上我已经使用过
of K up here and let's shift K by G sine
of K plus G actually I've already used

386
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:15,960
字母G，所以我们称其为G素数，将其移位K-K加G素数
the letter G so let's call this G Prime
shift it by K - K plus G Prime

387
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:27,720
因此，我们将其写为G加sub G加K加G素数e等于IK加G的总和
so we'll write it as sum over G a sub G
Plus K plus G prime e to the I K plus G

388
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,440
素数加G，但总和超过虚拟索引，因此我们可以定义一个虚拟
prime plus G but this sum is over a
dummy index so we can define a dummy

389
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,570
索引，它称为G旋转等于GG旋转
index
it's called G twiddle equals G G twiddle

390
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:44,130
向量等于G加G的素数向量，然后用那个代替
vector equals G Plus G prime vector and
then if you substitute that in that

391
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:57,330
成为G旋转向量的总和，G旋转向量加K e至i k r k + 
becomes sum over G twiddle vector a G
twiddle vector plus K e to the i ke r k+

392
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:02,520
 g旋转向量点r，它与我们开始时的表达式完全相同
g twiddle vector dot r which is exactly
the same expression that we started with

393
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,700
到那里，所以如果您将k倒移晶格向量g， 
up up there so if you shift k by a
reciprocal lattice vector g you get back

394
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,880
完全相同的波动函数，这就是我们试图在
exactly the same wave function which was
what we were trying to answer in the

395
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,140
首先是特殊的是，当您按倒数晶格向量移动k时
first place is it's special that when
you shift k by reciprocal lattice vector

396
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,800
你会得到完全相同的波动函数，这对紧
you get back exactly the same wave
function is that special to the tight

397
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,250
绑定模型不是它是较短方程和周期的属性
binding model it's not it's a property
of the shorter equation and periodic

398
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:29,820
可能还可以，所以这个定理的含义是
potential okay all right so the
implications of this theorem which is

399
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:43,110
被视为如此重要是一种暗示，一种激发一切
viewed as so important is one
implications one an excitation all

400
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:51,710
可以描述所有的激励z' 
excitations can be described all
excitation z' can be described be

401
00:36:51,710 --> 00:37:01,839
在一个BZ拥有的一枚青铜中描述，因为
described
in one bronze owned in one BZ because

402
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,140
每当您走出青铜所有者的大门时，您都可以相互交换
whenever you go outside of the bronze
owner you can just shift by a reciprocal

403
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:11,380
晶格矢量回到第一个，然后回到那个*区域
lattice vector to get back into the
first it back into that bran zone so

404
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,099
这是一个重要的声明第二个重要的声明可能更多
that's an important statement second
important statement may be more

405
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:27,249
重要的是周期性电势不会改变
important is that periodic potential a
periodic potential does not change does

406
00:37:27,249 --> 00:37:39,220
不分散晶体动量，这是我之前提到的
not scatter crystal momentum and this is
something that I mentioned before when

407
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:44,249
我们讨论了一个紧结合模型，该模型保持了晶体动量。 
we discuss a tight binding model that
the crystal momentum is conserved the

408
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:47,589
水晶动量始终保持不变，因为我们拥有
crystal momentum is always conserved in
the fact that that we have this very

409
00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:51,700
强大的周期性潜力不会破坏这就是如此的原因
strong periodic potential doesn't ruin
that this is the reason this is so

410
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,390
重要的是请记住，当我们研究Sommerfeld模型
important remember we had this puzzle
when we study the Sommerfeld model that

411
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,019
你有电子的平均自由程，这是巨大的李长
you have this mean free path of
electrons which is enormous Li long

412
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:02,829
数百个原子或数千个原子长，我们无法理解
hundreds of atoms or thousands of atoms
long and we couldn't understand it

413
00:38:02,829 --> 00:38:07,150
因为有一个大原子核，原子可以击中几乎每一个你不知道的原子
because there's a big nucleus that the
atom can hit every you know few

414
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:10,869
埃可以从数吨的核子中飞散而来
angstroms it could scatter off of tons
and tons of nuclei the point here is

415
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:15,400
你没有纯粹的平面波，你拥有的是修改过的平面
that the it you don't have pure plane
waves what you have is modified plane

416
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,940
波具有这些平面波乘以周期函数，但是一旦修改
waves you have these plane waves times a
periodic function but once you modify

417
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,239
将该平面波乘以该周期函数，则它是完美的
the plane wave by multiplying it by this
periodic function then it's perfectly

418
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:26,440
好的平面波可以完全穿过系统而不会发生散射
good plane wave to go all the way across
the system without scattering at all so

419
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,279
如果你带一个电子，你会把它放在一个小波包中
if you take a you know an electron you
put in a little wave packet of this

420
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:33,489
修改过的平面波，只要它在整个系统中传播， 
modified plane wave it would travel
clear across the system as long as it

421
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:38,230
不会碰到任何杂质或类似我们的讨厌的东西，但它可以
doesn't hit any impurities or our nasty
things like that but it could go all the

422
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,239
整个系统之间完全没有分散，因此这种解决方案解决了我们
way across the system without scattering
at all so this sort of resolves our our

423
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,119
电子为什么能在没有电子的情况下传播那么远的最初问题
initial issue of why it is that
electrons can travel so far without

424
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:51,940
没有分散好吗，这个结果是从哪里来的
without scattering okay and where did
this this result come from it's

425
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,200
重要的是要意识到这个重要结果确实来自毛伊岛的状况
important to realize that this important
result really came from maui's condition

426
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:00,609
这是因为周期性的电势仅以倒数的方式散射
it came from the fact that a periodic
potential only scatters u by reciprocal

427
00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:07,400
波向量没问题，所以这对我们不起作用的一件事是
wave vectors all right so the one thing
that this doesn't do for us is

428
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,839
无法解决它并不能帮助我们解决较短的问题
does not manage to it does not manage to
help us actually solve the shorter

429
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:19,970
方程式，因此解决缩短方程式的难度仍然很大，我们已经
equation so solving solving shortening
your equation is still hard and we've

430
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:28,369
已经讨论了一种实现方法，一种实现方法是类型绑定和按类型
already discussed one way to do it one
way to do it is type binding and by type

431
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:32,990
绑定我们真正在做的是从原子轨道开始
binding what we're really doing is we
start with start with atomic orbitals

432
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:46,339
与原子轨道，并允许周跳允许周跳，但那
with atomic orbitals and allow week
hopping allow week hopping but that

433
00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:50,960
听起来可能有点不通用，因为跳跃可能很强烈
might sound a little non-generic because
maybe the hopping is strong be from one

434
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,440
放在另一个地方，因此非常感谢您从一个角度思考它
place to another so it's useful to thank
you very useful to think about it from a

435
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,980
非常互补的观点，而不是从紧密的约束开始
very complimentary viewpoint where
instead of starting with a tight binding

436
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:09,849
我们从平面波开始的模型从平面波开始平面波和
model we start with plane waves start
with with plane waves plane waves and

437
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:23,059
加上R的弱周期性电位V，所以完全相反
add weak periodic potential V of R so
it's entirely the opposite way of

438
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:27,619
看一下这种方法的两种方法是已知的
looking at things
this approach approach to two is known

439
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:39,650
因为几乎是自由电子模型，几乎是自由电子模型， 
as the nearly free electron model nearly
free electron model and it's a very

440
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,809
一个有用的模型，可用于理解许多半导体和能带的物理性质
useful model for understanding a lot of
the physics of semiconductors and band

441
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:49,849
固体中的结构，让我们开始吧，我们大概开始吧
structure in solids so let's let's go
about that let's start it we probably

442
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:55,339
想今天完成它，所以我们如何开始
want to finish it today
but the so how do we do this we start

443
00:40:55,339 --> 00:41:02,150
我们的H零在K上是平面波而没有周期性势，所以更容易
with our H zero on K are plane waves
without the periodic potential so easier

444
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:11,299
好吧，在K上我们很容易Rho是通常的H条平方K平方超过2m，这是
okay on K we're easy Rho is the usual H
bar squared K squared over 2m it's a

445
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:19,299
一个好的开始，然后让我们假设V弱假设V弱
good place to start and then let's
assume V is weak assume weak V

446
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:23,260
好的，那么当您对一个物体的微弱干扰时该怎么办
all right so what do you do when you
have a weak perturbation to an

447
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,220
汉密尔顿算术，您使用的是您可能最后了解的微扰理论
hamiltonian well you use perturbation
theory which you presumably learned last

448
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,010
年，所以您还记得微扰理论中能量发生了什么变化
year so you remember what happens to the
energies in perturbation theory so it's

449
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:42,700
不以一阶扰动理论一阶扰动能量
not with first order perturbation theory
first order order pert the energy this

450
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,780
大概熟悉本征态K的波能
probably look familiar
the energy of the wave the eigenstate K

451
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:51,820
是没有干扰加上一阶的光秃秃的能量
is the bare energy without the
perturbation plus the first order

452
00:41:51,820 --> 00:42:00,430
摄动理论项，即KVK和此处的矩阵元素
perturbation theory term which is K V K
and this matrix element here

453
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:04,120
好吧，我将其滚动到了面板的顶部，也许我没有，也许我没有
well I scrolled it off the top of the
board No maybe I didn't maybe I did I

454
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:11,290
认为我确实将其定义为V sub 0，因为K减去K为0且该V sub 0 
think I did we defined it as V sub 0
because K minus K is 0 and this V sub 0

455
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:20,800
对于所有K，对于所有K都是相同的，所以这仅给出了一个整体常数
is the same same for all K for all K so
this just gives an overall constant

456
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,230
本征态的能量转移，因此本征态需要转移
energy shift of the the eigenstates so
they the eigenstates need to get shifted

457
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,650
能量上升或能量下降，这是零
up in energy or they get shifted down in
energy this is sort of the zeroth

458
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:33,910
这种势的傅立叶模式，无论在其顶部添加什么恒定势
Fourier mode of this potentials whatever
constant potential is added on top of

459
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:39,010
任何波动的势能都会在空间中发生变化，因此零傅立叶
any fluctuating potentials things that
change in space so the zeroth Fourier

460
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,150
势的模式只是将K的整体能量上下移动
mode of the of the potential just shifts
up and down the overall energy of K does

461
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:45,610
这个表达式看起来像您刚刚熟悉的一阶微扰理论
this expression look familiar first
order perturbation theory you just take

462
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:48,730
专家API很好，所以这并不有趣
the expert API ok
good so this is not interesting in as a

463
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:52,330
事实上，人们经常放弃v-0，因为他们太无趣了
matter of fact people frequently dropped
v-0 because it's so uninteresting they

464
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:57,160
只是摆脱它，我会尽力保留它，但也许我会误以为忘记它
just get rid of it I'll try to keep it
but maybe I'll forget it by mistake at

465
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:03,160
一点，所以二阶更有趣，所以它是二阶
some point so second-order is more
interesting so it's second-order you

466
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,130
拥有EK等于EK并不是裸露的东西加上v-0是一阶
have EK equals EK not that's the bare
piece plus v-0 that's the first-order

467
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:14,020
件，然后您有二阶件，它是K素数之和不等于
piece and then you have the second-order
piece which is sum of K prime not equal

468
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:24,640
到K，则我们有K个素数VK乘以B个子N的平方N减去e个素数
to K then we have K prime V K squared
over B sub K naught minus e K prime not

469
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:28,450
设置正确的顺序是的，从二阶微扰中看起来很熟悉
set the right order yeah does that look
familiar from second-order perturbation

470
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,600
好的理论现在好了，我们对此有什么了解
Theory good all right
now what do we know about this second

471
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:38,960
同样，我们有楼上矩阵元素的老挝缓解条件， 
well again we have Lao ease condition
for the upstairs matrix element that in

472
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,210
该矩阵元素为非零的顺序
order for that matrix element to be
nonzero

473
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:48,290
您必须有K个素数减去KI必须等于一个倒数晶格向量G，所以
you must have K prime minus K I must
equal a reciprocal lattice vector G so

474
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:55,400
该术语在这里可以重写为互易的晶格矢量G的总和
this term here can be re-written as sum
over G of reciprocal lattice vectors G

475
00:43:55,400 --> 00:44:07,220
 V sub G的平方，其中G是K素数减去K / e sub K等于n减去e sub K 
of V sub G squared where G is K prime
minus K / e sub K naught minus e sub K

476
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:17,540
加G看起来不太满意，还可以，所以这是我们的表情
plus G not good look happy with that
somewhat okay so this is our expression

477
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:23,120
对于我们开始的平面波能量的二阶位移， 
for the second-order shift in energy of
the plane waves that we started with but

478
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:26,120
我们必须对看起来像这样的表达式和
we have to be a little bit careful about
expressions that look like this and the

479
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,770
我们必须谨慎的原因是因为您可能会遇到两种情况
reason we have to be careful is because
you might have a situation where the two

480
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:34,670
分母中的两个术语彼此相等，在这种情况下， 
terms in the denominator are either
equal to each other in which case you

481
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,700
下楼为零或彼此非常接近，在这种情况下
get zero downstairs or very close to
each other in which case you get

482
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,390
楼下很小的东西，无论哪种情况，二阶项都会
something very small downstairs and in
either case the second-order term would

483
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,020
爆炸，在这种情况下，您会有分歧，这意味着
blow up in which case you have a
divergence and that means the

484
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:53,630
二阶微扰理论是不正确的，因此您必须小心
second-order perturbation theory is not
correct so you must be careful be

485
00:44:53,630 --> 00:45:04,370
小心当esup k这恰好是e sub K大约不等于e sub 
careful when esup k this just right it's
e sub K not approximately equal to e sub

486
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:08,360
 k加G现在什么时候发生
k plus G naught now when does that
happen

487
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,920
 e sub K实际上正好与K平方成正比，因此
well e sub K is actually just
proportional to K squared so that will

488
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:20,690
当绝对k等于绝对好加g时发生
happen when absolute k equals absolute
okay plus g well where's that you

489
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:28,089
记得在这里某处，这是存在的条件
remember somewhere here
there it is it's the condition for being

490
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:33,460
当您在青铜自己的边界上时，在青铜自己的边界上
on a bronze own boundary when you're on
bronze own boundary et sub K and E sub K

491
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:40,960
 + G实际上是相同的让我们为它画一幅画
+ G are actually the same let's actually
draw a picture of that so what we have

492
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:49,809
是的，这是我们的Barre光谱还可以，而II，Barre光谱只是一个
is we have a this is our Barre spectrum
okay and II the barre spectrum is just a

493
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:59,910
抛物线，所以这是e sub K是H bar平方而不是K平方超过2m，这是
parabola so this is e sub K is H bar
squared not K squared over 2m and here's

494
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:07,690
此处a的PI减去a的PI，并且这两个能量分开
PI over a here's minus PI over a and the
energy of these two these are separated

495
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:14,619
通过一个互易的晶格矢量，两个PI在a上，它们的能量相同，因此
by a reciprocal lattice vector two PI
over a and their energy is identical so

496
00:46:14,619 --> 00:46:17,849
这将使我们在二阶微扰理论上出现分歧
this would give us a divergence in
second order perturbation theory

497
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:29,170
类似地，如果我们在a上减去负2 PI，在a上减去2 PI，则这些被a隔开
similarly if we go to minus 2 PI over a
and 2 PI over a these are separated by a

498
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:34,299
 a上的倒数晶格矢量4 PI和它们的能量相同，所以它们
reciprocal lattice vector 4 PI over a
and their energies are identical so they

499
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:38,200
将使您在二阶微扰理论上有分歧，所以这个地方
will give you a divergence in second
order perturbation Theory so the place

500
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,200
二阶微扰理论失败的地方恰好是您在青铜上
where second order perturbation Theory
fails is exactly when you're on a bronze

501
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:52,289
自己的边界，所以我们需要做的是
own boundary so what we're going to need
to do is we are going to need to

502
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:56,619
可能下次必须做这个，但是我们要做什么来解决这个问题
probably gonna have to do this next time
but what we're going to do to fix this

503
00:46:56,619 --> 00:47:05,039
通过使用退化扰动理论解决问题
problem fix a problem by using using
degenerate perturbation Theory

504
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:12,450
退化它是摄动理论第三理论
degenerate
it's a perturbation theory third theory

505
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:18,640
希望你已经学到了一些东西，所以我们不会
which hopefully you've learned something
about already so we're not gonna have

506
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,569
是今天开始的时间，所以我要真正抓住机会
time to launch into that today so I'm
going to actually take the opportunity

507
00:47:22,569 --> 00:47:26,529
插入一条信息，或者可能插入两条信息
to insert one piece of information or
maybe two piece of information about

508
00:47:26,529 --> 00:47:30,670
我答应过你，我们会谈谈的
scattering that I promised you we would
talk about sometime and that is

509
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:36,320
分散的东西，所以也许我会把它放在这里
scattering off of so maybe I'll put that
over here scattering off of

510
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:41,900
 X射线和中子散射X射线和中子散射这是不同的
x-rays and neutron scattering x-ray and
neutron scattering this is a different

511
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:50,630
受试者刚刚插入了这最后五分钟，从
subject just inserted in this last five
minutes neutron scattering from from

512
00:47:50,630 --> 00:48:00,620
液体液体和无定形固体形态固体，因此在液体和
liquids liquids and amorphous solids
morphus solids so in liquids and

513
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:06,020
无定形固体我们没有周期性结构我们没有周期性
amorphous solids we do not have periodic
structures we do not have periodic

514
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,090
原子的排列，但是尽管如此，您仍然可以从中获得很多信息
arrangement of atoms but nonetheless you
get a lot of information out of the

515
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,970
中子X射线散射，如果您想回到我们做费米金像时
neutron x-ray scattering if you think
way back to when we did Fermi's Golden

516
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:18,830
规则，即散射幅度仍然是物体的傅立叶变换
Rule that the scattering amplitude is
still the Fourier transform of the

517
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,910
电位的周期性，但不是傅立叶变换的周期性
periodic of the potential but it's not a
periodic potential its Fourier transform

518
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:26,390
超过非周期性的潜力，但这是否意味着其中没有任何信息
over the non periodic potential but does
that mean there's no information in it

519
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:29,480
不，其中仍然有信息，只是您没有得到尖锐的峰
no there's still information in it it's
just that you don't get sharp Peaks

520
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,630
现在你得到的是在这里，所以这是液体上的X射线散射
anymore what you get is here there it is
so this is x-ray scattering on liquid

521
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:39,460
铝，它被加热到高温，所以它是液体
aluminium it's heated up to some high
temperature so it's so it's a liquid

522
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:44,120
有散射角或倒数向量的函数
there's a function of the scattering
angle or the reciprocal wave vector

523
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:50,720
那就是沿着这个轴的波向量，散射的幅度是
that's the the wave vector along this
axis the amplitude of scattering is has

524
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,690
峰和峰大致代表了原子之间的距离
Peaks and the peaks represent roughly
the distance between between atoms it's

525
00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,430
 1在原子之间的距离上以相同的方式表示峰
1 over the distance between atoms the
same way the peaks represent the

526
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,550
现在晶胞变成晶体时的周期性是
periodicity of the unit cell when it
becomes crystalline now what happens is

527
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:08,870
当您冷却液体时，它变得越来越结晶， 
as you cool down a liquid and it gets
more and more crystalline that becomes

528
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,320
越来越多的本地秩序，这些山峰变得越来越尖锐， 
more and more local order and these
Peaks get sharper and sharper and

529
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:16,880
最终变得更加清晰，当事物真正结晶时，它们就变成了三角洲
sharper and finally when the thing
actually crystallizes they become Delta

530
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,500
函数以我们期望的方式达到晶体的峰值，但是如果是
function Peaks the way we expected them
to for for a crystal but if it's a

531
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,950
液体，您可以将液体视为本地
liquid it's sort of you can sort of
think of a liquid as locally being like

532
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,950
固体，您知道每个原子都有几个邻居，但是如果您看起来
a solid you know each atom has a couple
neighbors but if you sort of look

533
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:31,730
更远的地方它不再有序了
farther away it's not ordered anymore it
sort of loses its order but if you sort

534
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:35,780
只是在某个小区域的外观，您可能已经知道它是有组织的
of look just in some small region it
probably has you know it's organized

535
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,300
在一个很小的区域内，因此您会在散射中得到这些宽峰
over a small region so you get these
sort of broad peaks in in the scattering

536
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:47,510
频谱好吧，我想也许我今天不会尝试涵盖任何其他问题， 
spectrum okay I think maybe I won't try
to cover any further issues today and

537
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:52,220
我们将在星期三再次开始，我认为周末愉快
we'll start again on
Wednesday I think have a good weekend

538
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:57,020
