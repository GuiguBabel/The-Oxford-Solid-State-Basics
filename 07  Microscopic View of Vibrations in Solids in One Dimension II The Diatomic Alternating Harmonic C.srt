1
00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:07,740
好吧，让我们开始吧欢迎回来这是精简版的第七讲
okay let's get started welcome back this
is the seventh lecture of the condensed

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,910
在上一堂课程中，我们介绍了一个非常重要的简单
matter course in the last lecture we
introduced a rather important simple

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,400
一维振动的质量单调谐波链链模型
model of vibrations in one dimension the
monotonic harmonic chain chain of masses

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,910
和弹簧每个弹簧都一样每个质量都一样极其简单
and Springs every spring is the same
every mass is the same extremely simple

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,930
模型，但是它为我们引入了很多非常重要的概念
model but it introduced a lot of very
important concepts to us we solved for

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,619
当我们量化系统时，链的所有正常模式
all of the normal modes of the chain
when we quantize the system we

7
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,930
通过对正常模式的量化发现了声子的含义
discovered the meaning of phonons with
the quantization of normal modes were we

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,100
介绍了水晶动量的概念，如果你转移一个想法
introduced the concept of crystal
momentum the idea that if you shift a

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,120
通过2 pi的波向量，您将获得与您相同的精确物理波
wave vector by 2 pi over a you get back
the same exact physical wave that you

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,110
首先，我们介绍了在k空间中布置青铜的概念
started with we introduced the concept
of a bronze own arranged in k space

11
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:50,730
通常取自2个PI的负PI，其中所有波矢都在
usually taken from minus PI over a 2 PI
over a where all of the wave vectors are

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,460
身体上不同的波浪，如果您走出布鲁恩斯区，就可以开始
physically different waves and if you go
outside the Bruins zone you just start

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,430
重复您已经描述的波浪，我们也设法
repeating the waves that you've already
described and we also managed to

14
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,260
精确计算该链的热容，然后将其与
calculate the heat capacity of this
chain exactly and we compared it to the

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:05,519
我们以前看过的德拜理论和爱因斯坦理论之一
Debye theory and the Einstein theory
that we had looked at previously now one

16
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,840
我们用于此模型的简化假设是
of the simplifying assumptions we used
going into this model was that every

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,710
链中的单个质量和每个弹簧都是相同且真实的
single mass and every single spring in
this chain were the same and in real

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,820
材料通常具有不同类型的原子，例如钠
materials you typically have different
types of atoms for example in sodium

19
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,759
氯化物，你将有一个钠原子和一个氯原子，这些将是
chloride you'll have a sodium atom and a
chlorine atom and these will be

20
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,540
不同，所以也许更好的典型材料模型看起来会有些变化
different so maybe a better model of a
typical material would look something

21
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,619
像这样，我在绘制一个深色原子时会有一个浅色原子
like this you'd have a light-colored
atom in a dark colored atom I'm drawing

22
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,110
一维的一切，然后是暗的浅色原子
everything in one dimension again and
then a light colored atom in a dark

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,960
彩色的原子和深色的灯杆，等等
colored atom and a light pole down the
dark color down and so forth let me

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,460
介绍一些有用的术语，单位单元格的概念是
introduce some nomenclature that's gonna
be useful the idea of a unit cell is the

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:58,290
重复重复的图案，例如，我们可以将这个单元格放在这个盒子里， 
repeated repeated motif so for example
we can take our unit cell this box and

26
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,700
如果您一遍又一遍地重复此框，并且将框堆叠在一起而没有
if you repeat this box over and over and
you stack the boxes together with no

27
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,340
您之间的空间将重建整个链条另一个重要的词
space in between you will reconstruct
the entire chain another important word

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:16,200
我们上次介绍的是晶格常数，我们定义为
that we introduced last time
is lattice constant which we defined as

29
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,590
我们通常称之为a，我们将其定义为距离之间的距离
what we usually call it a and we defined
it as the distance between distance

30
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:41,040
在我们等价的原子之间，例如，像这样的晶格常数
between we equivalent atoms so for
example lattice constant like this we'll

31
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,240
从这个像把原子变成这个浅色原子这样称呼它
call it a from this like put atom to
this light color atom you may also

32
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:52,370
请注意，晶格常数也恰好是晶胞的大小
notice that that lattice constant also
happens to be the size of the unit cell

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,900
像这样的距离，如果我正确驾驶，现在也是一侧
like this this distance here is also a
if I drove properly it was now one side

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,340
评论是，左边的晶胞实际上不是唯一的，让我画
comment is that the left the unit cell
is actually not unique let me draw

35
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:16,970
我还可以同样好地画出该链的另一幅图
another picture of this chain I could
have drawn the unit cell equally well

36
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:24,530
这样，所以我们甚至应该写下来，因为
like this so that's something we should
probably even write down because it's

37
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:33,660
重要的晶胞不是唯一的，如果我选择这是一个晶胞，我可以
important unit cell not unique and if I
had chosen this is a unit cell I could

38
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:41,910
将这些重复项堆叠在一起，并同样构建整个链
stack duplications of that together and
build up the entire chain just as well

39
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,800
现在，我们今天将要进行的实际计算是尝试
now what we're going to do today in a
real calculation is we're going to try

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:53,970
计算看起来像这样的链的火车的正常模式
to calculate the normal modes of a train
of a chain that looks like this and the

41
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,330
我们这样做的原因不仅仅是增加我们已经存在的问题的复杂性
reason we're doing this is not just to
add complexity to a problem we already

42
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,380
实际上是通过在链中具有不同类型的原子来解决的
solved last time in fact by having
different types of atoms in our chain

43
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,140
我们将看到一些根本不同的东西
we're going to see that some
fundamentally new and different things

44
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,410
发生所以这就是为什么这就是我们这样做的原因，所以让我画出这样的链条
occur so that's why that's why we're
doing it so let me draw the chain this

45
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:13,820
被称为交替链
is known as the alternating chain

46
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,260
通常被称为交替链，有时会注意到双原子
frequently known as the alternating
chain sometimes notice the diatomic

47
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,070
链，看起来像这样，有一个
chain
and it looks kind of like this there's a

48
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,000
黑暗的亚当，然后是光的亚当，黑暗的亚当，然后是光的亚当，黑暗的亚当，是光
dark Adam then a light Adam dark Adam
and a light Adam the dark Adam a light

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:39,020
亚当，他们与斯普林斯相连，依此类推
Adam they're connected together with
Springs and so forth

50
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:46,100
我们有一个晶格常数a，它是相同的
and we have a lattice constant a which
is the distance between identical you

51
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,310
看到明暗之间的差异已经足够清晰了
see the difference between the light and
dark have made clear enough you can see

52
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,980
好的，所以a是等效原子之间的距离，所以光是亚当之间
that okay so a is the distance between
equivalent atoms so between light Adam

53
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,360
和光亚当，现在我们可以选择我们要写下的模型
and light Adam and now we have a choice
as to what model we want to write down

54
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,990
人们在解决这两个方面有两个共同的选择
and there's two common choices that
people make in solving these two

55
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:07,040
单独的问题，但它们相似，经常做出的一个选择是
separate problems but they're similar
one choice is frequently made is to make

56
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,330
亮原子的质量暗原子的质量不同我们不会去
the mass of the light atom the mass of
the dark atom different we're not going

57
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,330
解决您可以实际解决的典型家庭作业
to solve that you can actually solve
that for homework that one is a typical

58
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,540
选择我们要解决的是，我们要使两个不同
choice what we're gonna solve instead is
we're going to make the two different

59
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:22,550
今年春天的首都一号泉和今年春天的卡帕二号泉，我们
Springs this spring Capital One and this
spring Kappa two different and we're

60
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:27,680
让他们来回交替kappa 1 kappa 2 kappa 1 kappa 2等等
gonna let them alternate back and forth
kappa 1 kappa 2 kappa 1 kappa 2 and so

61
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,910
第四，因此命名为交替链，因为弹簧交替
forth and hence the name alternating
chain because the springs alternate

62
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,220
在资本一和卡伯之间到这两个链的物理
between capital one and Kappa to the
physics of these two chains whether

63
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,940
我们让群众交替或弹簧交替是极端
we're letting the masses alternate or
the springs alternate is extremely

64
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,000
非常相似，我们之所以这样做，是因为它是代数的
extremely similar the reason we're doing
this one is because it's algebraically

65
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,930
只是比您要做的要容易一些
just slightly easier to keep track of
than the one you're going to do for

66
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:53,750
作业在代数上稍微复杂些，所以让我们写下来
homework which is slightly algebraically
more complicated so let's write down

67
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:58,400
一些坐标，例如，让我们让浅色原子具有
some coordinates so for example let's
let the light colored atoms have

68
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,350
 XN位置和深色原子的位置为Y n，所以让我们
positions X N and the dark colored atoms
have position Y n so for example let's

69
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:16,220
让这个为x1这个为y1这个为X 2这个为Y 2等等
let this one be x1 this one will be y1
this one be X 2 this will be Y 2 and so

70
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,210
现在，我们解决这类质量和弹簧问题的方法
forth and now the way we solve problems
like this these mass and spring problems

71
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,760
你是从写下牛顿的运动方程开始的，好吧，我
is you start by writing down Newton's
equations of motion so well okay I

72
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,310
应该再指出一个定义Delta X和Delta Y 
should point one more definition the
Delta X and Delta Y

73
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:40,960
平衡创造的偏离平衡位置的偏离
deviations from equilibrium creations
from equilibrium position from from

74
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:50,080
平衡好了，我们将用以下公式写下牛顿方程
equilibrium okay and we're gonna write
down Newton's equations in terms of

75
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,540
这些Delta X和Delta Y，所以也许也许我会把它放在另一个
these Delta X and Delta Y so maybe
actually maybe I'll put it on another

76
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:04,420
另一块板在这里，所以质量Delta X双点
another board here
so mass Delta X double dot

77
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:09,340
质量乘以加速度等于我们在X上必须要小心一点
mass times acceleration equals we have
to be a little bit careful here on X

78
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:18,100
一个轻原子在其右边具有Kappa 2 Kappa 2，然后在其右侧
atom a light atom on the right it has a
Kappa 2 Kappa 2 and then on the right of

79
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:25,270
 X原子是具有相同数字的ay原子，所以Delta Y和负Delta X n 
an X atom is a y atom with the same
number so Delta Y and minus Delta X n

80
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:33,400
然后在左边是大写字母加资本一，在左边是
and then on its left is a capital one
plus Capital One and on its left is a

81
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:40,060
指数低一的Delta Y原子是Delta X n每个人都同意吗
Delta Y atom with the index one lower is
Delta X n does everyone agree with that

82
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,120
 X 2的左边是y 1，所以我必须大写一个弹簧
that on the left of X 2 is y 1 so I have
to the capital one spring has the lower

83
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:55,750
索引是好高兴好吧好然后Delta Y和双点好
index yes good happy all right good
and then and Delta Y and double dot okay

84
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:02,200
因此在a的右边，为什么索引号为高的X是一个
so on the right of a why is an X with
the index one higher and that's a

85
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:10,810
大写一个春天，所以Delta X n加1减去Delta YN并在左Kappa上
Capital One spring so Delta X n plus 1
minus Delta Y N and on the Left Kappa

86
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:16,570
 Y左边的两个是X 1，因此它是相同索引Delta X的X 
two on the left of Y one is X 1 so it's
an X for the same index Delta X and

87
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:23,050
减去Delta Y，我想我没事，所以这是我们的等式
minus Delta Y and I think I got that
right ok so those are our equations of

88
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:30,880
运动和解决问题的方式与我们上次所做的方式相同
motion and the way we're going to solve
this is the same way we did last time we

89
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:36,460
会在Zods的Zots wave上写下一波
will write down a wave on Zots
wave on Zod's so there's some

90
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,210
圆点这个词在德语中实际上是什么意思，而我实际上是不同意
disagreement on what the word on dots
actually meant in german and i actually

91
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:43,929
所以有人在演讲后拦住了我，一位德语发言者说不，不，你是对的
so someone stopped me after lecture a
german speaker said no no you were right

92
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:46,740
关于点的意思，然后别人说不，不，你错了
about what on dots means and then
someone else said no no you're wrong

93
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,190
然后我问了几个德国人，他们都不同意，然后
and then I asked a couple German
speakers and they all disagreed and then

94
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:53,430
实际上有人指出anzats实际上是一个英文单词
actually someone pointed out that anzats
is actually an English word it's in the

95
00:08:53,430 --> 00:09:00,780
 OED，您可以查找它，这意味着数学上的猜测，所以我会这样
OED you can look it up it means it means
mathematical guess so so I'm gonna so

96
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,280
在那里真的很好，所以无论如何我们都要写下我们的
it's in there it really is okay so
anyway we're going to write down our

97
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:14,030
在点上波动，因此Delta xn对I Omega t减去IK以及a和
wave on dots so Delta xn is some a n e
to the I Omega t minus I K and a and

98
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:22,200
 Delta yn会混淆这是怎么称呼ax和I e到I Omega t 
Delta yn is oopss how that's called to
ax rather and a Y e to the I Omega t

99
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,840
减去IK和a，我们上次真正指的是
minus I K and a and what we really mean
as last time is where we mean to

100
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,200
实际上占据了整个表达的真正部分，因此
actually take the real part of this
whole expression and because of that

101
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,760
我们可以选择Omega大于零，但K可以是
we're allowed to choose Omega greater
than equal to zero but K can be either

102
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:45,320
在任一符号上签名以表示现在向左或向右波浪
sign either sign to represent either
left going or right going waves now as

103
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,500
上次我们意识到，如果您取K，然后将其转换为K加2 pi 
with last time we realized that if you
take K and you shift it to K plus 2 pi

104
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,950
超过一个，您会返回完全相同的波浪，其原因是因为
over a you get back exactly the same
wave and the reason for that is because

105
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:02,790
如果您查看指数系数e到负IK加2 pi的倍数
if you look at the exponential factor e
to the minus I K plus 2 pi over a times

106
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:11,010
 n是IK的一遍乘以n等于IK的e完全相同
n is times a times a times n is equal to
exactly the same thing as e to the I K

107
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:19,170
以及那两个完全相同的匹配项，因此，如果您将K移2 pi 
and a matches that those two are exactly
the same so if you shift K by the 2 pi

108
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,570
超过一个，您获得完全相同的波形，但实际上我们很重要
over a you get back exactly the same
wave form rather important in fact we

109
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:29,700
上次发现只是另外两件事，我们将定期使用
found out last time just a couple other
things we're going to use periodic

110
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,800
边界条件周期边界论文我们使用长度为L的系统
boundary conditions periodic boundaries
theses we use a system of length L

111
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:48,300
等于n乘以a，所以这意味着我们有n个晶胞晶胞，如果我们有一个
equals n times a so this means we have n
unit cells unit cells and if we have a

112
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:54,000
 L大小的系统，这意味着案件必须处于周期性边界条件
system of size L that means the case
must be on a periodic boundary condition

113
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,740
必须是L乘以P的2 PI，其中P是整数，因此间距
must be 2 PI over L times P where P is
an integer so the spacing

114
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:06,860
在不同的L之间，K的不同可能值是L上的两个PI 
between different L different possible
values of K are two PI over L so now if

115
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:14,390
我们要计算不同情况的数量，我们进行了完全相同的计算
we want to count the number of different
case we did exactly the same calculation

116
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,150
上次不同情况等于两个PI的可能情况范围
last time different case that equals the
range of possible case that's two PI

117
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,560
在开始重复之前，您可以在a上移动两个PI并得到
over a before we start repeating since
you can shift by two PI over a and get

118
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,840
以相同的方式返回，k之间的间隔是L上的两个PI 
the same way back and the spacing
between k's is two PI over L that gives

119
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,370
我们在a或n上获得L，因此不同Ches的数量
us L over a or n so the number of
different Ches

120
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:44,000
等于系统中单位晶胞的数量
is equal to the number of unit cells in
the system a rather general rule that we

121
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:52,490
会使用很多次，所以考虑到我们的波浪点，我们可以解决这个问题
will use many times okay so given our
wave on dots up there we can solve this

122
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:58,670
牛顿方程组是通过插入并做一点点
set of Newton's equations it's by
plugging in and doing a little bit of

123
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:02,000
代数，然后我承认我要做的代数有点
algebra and then I concede that the
algebra I'm about to do is a little bit

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:10,130
凌乱，但请忍受我，所以这里首先我们要为Delta xn插入，所以两个
messy but bear with me so here goes
first we'll plug in for Delta xn so two

125
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:18,500
导数给我减去Omega平方M，则波是I Omega t的轴心
derivatives gives me minus Omega squared
M then the wave is ax e to the I Omega t

126
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:28,900
减去IK和a，等于好就等于Kappa 2倍Delta Y n 
minus I K and a and that equals well
okay equals Kappa 2 times Delta Y n

127
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,990
这就是为什么e等于I Omega t减去IK，而a然后让我们做另一个
which is a why e to the I Omega t minus
I K and a and then let's do the other

128
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:39,830
资本，让我们在另一个y词上做另一个词，所以加上
capital let's do the other term over
here the other y term so that's plus

129
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:49,160
 I Omega t减去IK的大写字母e，然后是n减去1 a，因为它是
Capital One e to the I Omega t minus I K
and then it's n minus 1 a because it's

130
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,310
指数n减去1，然后让我们做2个X项，所以我们有减去Capital 1 
an index n minus 1 and then let's do the
2 X terms so we have minus Capital 1

131
00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:05,270
加上Kappa 2a X哎呀，我在这里错过了一个Y，不是I Omega t的一个斧头
plus Kappa 2a X oops I missed an a Y
here didn't I a Y ax e to the I Omega t

132
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:13,420
减去IK，每个对此都感到满意的人，我都做了正确认识的Jex 
minus I K and a everyone happy with that
did I do that correctly known Jex seems

133
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:21,010
工作正常，然后另一个方程式是减去Ω的平方M，为什么e到I 
work okay and then the other equation is
minus Omega squared M a why e to the I

134
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:30,460
 Omega t减去IK和一个等于，让我们先做两个x项， 
Omega t minus I K and a equals and let's
do the two x terms first so we have

135
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,890
大写1轴e到I Omega t减去I K，然后是第二个系数
capital 1 ax e to the I Omega t minus I
K and then the coefficient in the second

136
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,770
 DX的索引方程（大写为1）有n加1，所以它是n加
equation of the the index of DX with
capital one has n plus 1 so it's n plus

137
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:56,620
 1 n在这里，然后我们得到Iωt减去IK的+ kappa 2轴e和a和
1 n here and then we have + kappa 2 ax e
to the I Omega t minus I K and a and

138
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:05,070
然后是2个上限，然后是两个Y项减去资本1加Kappa 2a Y e 
then the 2 cap then the to the two Y
terms minus capital 1 plus Kappa 2a Y e

139
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,290
等于IΩ减去IK，关于该方程式值得注意的是
to the I Omega t minus I K and a a
notable thing about this equation is

140
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,080
这是我全年要写在黑板上的最长方程
it's the longest equation I'm going to
write on the chalkboard all year long

141
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,180
现在完成了，所以我们不必再做一次，但是实际上
and now it's done so we never have to do
that again but it's not actually

142
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,200
看起来很复杂，因为有很多指数因素
complicated as it might look because
there's a bunch of exponential factors

143
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,870
他们退出了双方取消，所以我们有两个方程，我们可以
which drop out they cancel on both sides
so we have two equations and we can

144
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,540
简化成一个矩阵方程
simplify it into one matrix equation

145
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:43,300
我将这样写，减去M Omega平方乘以向量ax ay等于
I'll write it this way minus M Omega
squared times the vector ax a y equals

146
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:52,660
一些大矩阵乘以向量ax到Y，大矩阵是什么
some big matrix times the vector ax a Y
and the big matrix is what is it it's a

147
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,960
减去资本1加Kappa 2，然后减去资本1加Kappa 2 
minus Capital 1 plus Kappa 2 and then
minus Capital 1 plus Kappa 2 on the

148
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:05,770
对角Kappa 1加Kappa 2，然后关闭对角线具有Kappa 2加
diagonal Kappa 1 plus Kappa 2 and then
the off diagonal has Kappa 2 plus

149
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:12,280
 IK a的大写1 e就是那部分指数没有取消
Capital 1 e to the I K a that's that
part of the exponential didn't cancel it

150
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:19,950
来自加号1，然后是Kappa 2加资本一减IK a 
comes from the plus 1 and then the Kappa
2 plus Capital One the minus I K a

151
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,610
从指数中的负1出来的每个人都很好
coming from the minus 1 in the
exponential is everyone good with that

152
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,500
好吧，好的，这是一个特征值
agree ok all right
so what is this this is an eigenvalue

153
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,750
等式中，这个人的特征值减去M Omega平方， 
equation where the eigenvalue is this
guy over here minus M Omega squared and

154
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,610
解决特征值方程的方法是将M Omega平方移至
the way you solve an eigenvalue equation
is by moving the M Omega squared to the

155
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,320
对角线在这边，然后将行列式设置为0， 
diagonals over on this side then you set
the determinant equal to 0 you get the

156
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,200
特征行列式或特征方程式，有时
characteristic determinant or
characteristic equation or sometimes

157
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:52,750
如果我们做到这一点，则称为世俗方程式
called the secular equation if we do
that the one-step M Omega squared minus

158
00:15:52,750 --> 00:16:02,730
大写1加Kappa 2的平方除以Kappa 2加大写One e到PI K a 
Capital 1 plus Kappa 2 all squared minus
Kappa 2 plus Capital One e to the PI K a

159
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:11,620
绝对值平方等于0，我们可以很快解决这一问题。 
absolute value squared equals 0 and we
can solve that rather rapidly M Omega

160
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:19,060
平方等于资本1加Kappa 2加上或减去绝对值Kappa 2 
squared equals capital 1 plus Kappa 2
plus or minus absolute value Kappa 2

161
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:27,520
再加上资本1 e到i pi K a，这就是我们的解决方案
plus Capital 1 e to the I pi K a and
that's our solution now one thing you

162
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,220
可能会注意到，对于每个K，欧米茄都有两种可能的解决方案
may notice is that for each K there are
two possible solutions of Omega the plus

163
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,800
解决方案中的负解正确，这样就可以在这里写下
solution in the minus solution right so
as that mean write it down over here

164
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:51,610
每个K都有两个正常模式模式，我们可以称它们为Omega plus和minus ok， 
each K has two normal modes modes we can
call them Omega plus and minus ok and

165
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,870
我们有多少个k，k的个数等于单位数
how many k's do we have the number of
k's are equal to the number of unit

166
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,990
单元，每个k有两个正常模式的两倍，所以正常模式的数量
cells and each k has two times two
normal modes so number of normal modes

167
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:12,609
正常模式的数量等于单位电池数量的两倍，并且它的销量等于
number of normal modes equals two times
number of unit cells and it sells equals

168
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,068
数量，这是我们应该期望的，因为我们有这个数量

169
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,240
质量是我们拥有的自由度的数量，所以当我们解决这个问题时
of masses is the number of degrees of
freedom we have so when we solve this

170
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,319
问题在于，有许多正常模式，而实际上我们这样做了
problem which is that exactly that many
normal modes and indeed we do so that's

171
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,010
这很好，我现在对所有的好都感到满意，因此对
that's good good I'm happy with that
all right good now so it's useful to

172
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,610
实际画出这个东西，我先将其勾画出来，然后我们将
actually plot this thing and I'm going
to sketch it out first and then we'll

173
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,540
某种理由说明为什么它看起来像这样做
sort of justify why it looks the way it
does

174
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:50,680
所以在这里我要在这里绘制K在这是Omega好的PI在
so here I'm gonna plot
here's K here's Omega okay PI over a is

175
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,110
负PI超过负PI，所以这是
minus PI over a minus PI over a so
that's the wrong zone outside of the

176
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,010
布劳恩斯拥有的一切都会重复，所以我们应该有一个像这样的模式
Brauns own everything just repeats so we
should have a mode that looks like this

177
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:08,800
然后更高频率的模式看起来像这样，然后您可以
and then a higher frequency mode maybe
looks like this okay and then you could

178
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,330
实际上定期在外部复制它，我的意思是你可以做到
actually reproduce this periodically
outside I mean you could you can make it

179
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,640
随心所欲继续前进，因为当您将所有PI移到两个PI上时
go onwards as you like because as you
shift everything by two PI over a you

180
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,120
只是回到同一波，但我们要真正专注于青铜
just get back the same wave but we're
gonna really focus on the bronze own

181
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,690
因为在这里拥有的青铜器中，您发现的每个波浪都与每个波浪不同
because within the bronze own here every
wave you find is different from every

182
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:32,800
另一波现在在这里看起来可能会有用
other wave now it's useful here to
probably look a little bit more

183
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,550
仔细查看此图，看看为什么它看起来像我绘制的样子，所以让我们
carefully at this plot and see why it
looks the way I've drawn it so let's

184
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:43,840
看一些方便的点，也许K等于零，这对
look at some convenient points maybe at
K equals zero that's a good point to

185
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,980
好好看看K等于0发生了什么，所以在这里我们有这个绝对值
look at well what happens with K equals
zero so over here we have this absolute

186
00:18:50,980 --> 00:19:03,160
 K 2加K 1 e等于i K等于K 2加K 1，所以M Omega平方是
K 2 plus K 1 e to the i ka that goes to
just K 2 plus K 1 so M Omega squared is

187
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:12,850
是K 1加K 2的2倍，或者是0，所以我在这里画出K处的0 
either 2 times K 1 plus K 2 or at 0 and
so I've drawn that here here's 0 at K

188
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,380
等于0，这是较高的能量1可能能够吸收较高的能量
equals 0 and here is the higher energy 1
may be able to draw the higher energy

189
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:25,350
一个也因此Omega加K等于0是2的平方根1加Kappa 2 
one also so Omega plus at K equals 0 is
square root of 2 capital 1 plus Kappa 2

190
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:32,080
我认为艾玛对这个观点的看法是对的，所以这里的要点是平方根
over Emma take it that right I think so
so that point here give it a square root

191
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:40,090
 2的资本1加m的Kappa 2，所以我们有Loranger模式
of 2 capital 1 plus Kappa 2 over m and
we so we have the Loranger mode with the

192
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,660
高能模式现在低能模式我们将回到氢动力
high energy mode now the low energy mode
we will come back to the hydrogen motive

193
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,170
时刻，但低能量低频模式是我们应该期望的一种
moment but the low energy low frequency
mode is one that we should expect should

194
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,320
曾经去过那里，因为我们应该期望应该在某处有声波
have been there because we should expect
that there should be Soundwave somewhere

195
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,760
在系统中，当有声波时，我们注意到
in the system and when there are sound
waves we notice

196
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:57,140
具有在波矢量中具有线性频率的频谱的方法，以及
ways to have a spectrum which is has
frequency linear in wave vector and

197
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,280
现在以零波矢降到零，以说服自己，这就是
comes down to zero at zero wave vector
now to convince ourselves that's what's

198
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,840
继续这个方程，我们实际上需要做更多的数学运算
going on with this equation we have to
actually do a little bit of more math

199
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,970
并将色散曲线扩展到K等于零附近，让我们看看如何做到这一点
and expand the dispersion curve near K
equals zero so let's see how we do that

200
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:25,760
因此，让我们将K 2加K 1 e取到i ka那个数量是
so let's take K 2 plus K 1 e to the i ka
that quantity there is well yeah that

201
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,100
东西可以写成平方根Kappa 2平方加Kappa 1 
thing there can be written as square
root Kappa 2 squared plus Kappa 1

202
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:43,310
 ka的平方加2 kappa 1 kappa 2余弦
squared plus 2 kappa 1 kappa 2 cosine of
ka just by multiplying that out and if K

203
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:50,450
很小，我们将用1减去K乘以2的平方来代替余弦
is small we're going to replace this
cosine by 1 minus K a squared over 2 so

204
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:55,610
那么我们所拥有的就是我可以这样写它的平方根
then what we have is I guess we can
write it like this square root of this

205
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:03,770
整个Kappa 2加Kappa 1平方，当我放置时会照顾1个学期
whole thing Kappa 2 plus Kappa 1 squared
that takes care of the 1 term when I put

206
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,880
这个和这个加在一起，我得到Kappa 1加Kappa 2的平方，然后是什么
together this this and this I get Kappa
1 plus Kappa 2 squared and then what's

207
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:16,760
剩下的就是二元对消kappa 1 kappa 2 ka平方我得到我想要的
left over is the twos cancel kappa 1
kappa 2 ka squared I get that I want to

208
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:26,960
这样做是的，那么这很方便地分解出一个Kappa 2 plus Kappa 
do that yeah ok then this conveniently
factors out to give a Kappa 2 plus Kappa

209
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:38,930
 1的平方根加Kappa 1 Kappa 2 ka平方大写1 
1 times the square root of 1 plus Kappa
1 Kappa 2 ka squared over capital 1

210
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:45,890
 kappa 2平方，如果您还记得1的平方根加X oops负数
kappa 2 squared and if you remember
square root of 1 plus X oops negative

211
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:54,080
签错了他们签错了-那是-没有人拿到巧克力
sign wrong they got a sign wrong
that's - that's - no one gets chocolate

212
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:04,010
因为那是一个减去两个的x，所以我们可以将其重写为
for that is one minus x over two so so
then we have we can rewrite this as

213
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:11,920
卡伯2加资本一号-卡伯1卡伯2 ka 
Kappa 2 plus Capital One - kappa 1 kappa
2 ka

214
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,740
平方乘以2个大写字母1加Kappa- 
squared over 2 capital 1 plus Kappa -

215
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:23,770
我错过了什么吗？ 
does that look right did I miss anything

216
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:36,380
是的，kappa 1让我们加盖-谢谢kappa longo的kappa-是，是的，很好，谢谢
yeah kappa 1 let's cap - thank you kappa
Longo's kappa - yeah yeah good thank you

217
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,270
谁说我不是Michalka迟到的人，是的，好的，所以我没有
whoever said that I wasn't Michalka
late' yeah ok ok good so I don't have

218
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,970
今天我要带一个，但是我讨厌它，所以如果我插上那个
one today I was gonna bring one but I
hate it so alright so if I plug that

219
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:52,790
进入此处，我们看到大写字母1加Kappa-与- 
into into here we see that the capital 1
plus Kappa - with the with the -

220
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:58,580
解决方案取消了此溶质，将资本金加Kappa取消-也将取消
solution cancels this solute this
capital 1 plus Kappa - also will cancel

221
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:04,390
这样，我们最终将得到em将使平方成为M Omega平方
this and we'll end up just getting em
will make a squared M Omega squared

222
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:14,380
等于资本1 kappa 2 ka平方2 kappa 1加Kappa-或等价
equals capital 1 kappa 2 ka squared over
2 kappa 1 plus Kappa - or equivalently

223
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:25,700
欧米茄是平方根kappa 1 kappa 2 a平方超过2 kappa 1加Kappa 2 em 
Omega is square root kappa 1 kappa 2 a
squared over 2 kappa 1 plus Kappa 2 em

224
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:32,570
在那儿，然后绝对K没问题，我意识到这是很多数学
down there and then absolute K all right
and I realize that's a lot of math we're

225
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:37,370
今年不会做太多那么重的数学运算，但必须每学一次
not going to do too much math that heavy
this year but have to do it once in a

226
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:44,720
虽然很好，所以我们将其识别为声速，所以我们只是推导了
while okay so this we recognize as the
sound velocity so we just derived the

227
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,170
该波的声速声速是该曲线的斜率
sound velocity of this wave the sound
velocity is the slope of this curve here

228
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,720
现在通常我应该使用人们通常参考的适当术语
now usually actually I should use the
proper nomenclature usually people refer

229
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,430
以此作为声学模式
to this as the acoustic mode

230
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:08,749
他们倾向于称其为声学模式，甚至一直到该区域
and they tend to call it the acoustic
mode even all the way out to the zone

231
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:13,940
即使在K的情况下实际上只是声音
boundary out here at very high K even
though it's really only sound when it's

232
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,019
长，当它是长波长或小K时，它们在这里称为整个分支
long and when it's long wavelength or
small K they call the whole branch here

233
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:23,499
声学模式现在您还记得上一次我们导出声速时
the acoustic mode now you remember last
time when we derive the sound velocity

234
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:27,710
我们还能够通过使用氢获得相同的声速
we also were able to derive the same
sound velocity by using a hydrogen

235
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,580
原子参数，所以让我们看看这次是否可以再次执行此操作
atomic argument so let's see if we can
do that again this time remember from

236
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,909
在流体力学方面，我们认为V声在整个过程中应等于1的平方根。 
hydrodynamics we have that the V sound
should equal square root of 1 over the

237
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:43,429
质量密度乘以可压缩性质量密度很好有两个
mass density times the compressibility
the mass density is well there are two

238
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:49,039
每个晶格常数a的质量和我们上次得出的可压缩性
masses per lattice constant a and the
compressibility well we derive last time

239
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,570
压缩系数应在弹簧常数乘以a和的基础上为1 
the compressibility should be 1 over the
spring constant times a and the spring

240
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:58,490
这里的单元格中有两个弹簧，一个弹簧
constant well here the the unit cell has
two springs in it and the spring

241
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:03,830
两个弹簧串联的常数是kappa 1 kappa 2超过大写字母1 plus 
constant for two springs in series is
kappa 1 kappa 2 over capital 1 plus

242
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:09,320
 Kappa 2听起来很熟悉吗，记得从第一年起
Kappa 2 does that sound familiar
remember that from first year ok so if

243
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:15,889
我们把这个和这个和这个插入这里，实际上我们得到完全相同的结果V 
we plug this and this and this into here
in fact we get exactly the same result V

244
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:24,230
声音等于平方根大写1 kappa 2 a平方超过2m的大写1加
sound equals square root capital 1 kappa
2 a squared over 2m of capital 1 plus

245
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:30,740
 Kappa 2，因此流体力学计算可为您提供与我们完全相同的结果
Kappa 2 so the hydrodynamic calculation
gives you exactly the same result as we

246
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:36,769
通过完全解决系统问题得到的，现在让我们谈谈
got by actually solving the system
completely now let's talk about this

247
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:42,110
此处的模式与声学模式相比
mode up here this mode is known in
comparison to the acoustic mode this

248
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:50,269
模式在K时称为光学模式光学模式高频模式
mode is known as the optical mode
optical mode high frequency mode at K

249
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:56,269
等于0，我们可能应该说我应该告诉你为什么这个名字
equals 0 and we should probably I mean I
should probably tell you why the name

250
00:25:56,269 --> 00:26:01,999
光学模式，因此“光学模式”一词来自真实实测
optical mode so the word optical mode
comes from experiments on on real real

251
00:26:01,999 --> 00:26:07,279
当您在材料上照射光并引起振动时
materials when you shine light on the
material and you induced vibrations by

252
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,179
如果您想一想，现在就照耀着太阳
Sun by shining light on it now if you
think for a second what's the property

253
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:18,749
我们知道类似声光的频率为
of light that we know similar
sound light has frequency which is

254
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:23,580
与其波矢成比例，唯一的不同是C很大
proportional to its wave vector the only
big difference is that C is huge

255
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:30,869
与声速相比，如果我在同一条曲线上绘制光散射曲线
compared to sound velocity so if I drew
the light dispersion curve on the same

256
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:37,679
绘制一条非常陡峭的斜线，可能像这样陡峭
plot it would be an extremely steep
sloped line like this probably so steep

257
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,549
如果您想象材料上闪烁着光，我现在什至无法绘制它
I couldn't even draw it now if you
imagine shining light on a material and

258
00:26:44,549 --> 00:26:49,169
在量子力学中产生振动，我们应该考虑吸收光子
creating vibrations in quantum mechanics
we should think about absorbing a photon

259
00:26:49,169 --> 00:26:54,990
并创建一个声子，然后想象一个吸收光子和
and creating a phonon so imagine a
process where you absorb a photon and

260
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:00,149
创造一个声子为了做到这一点，你必须节约能量
create a phonon in order for that to
happen you have to conserve both energy

261
00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:04,740
和动量，所以您必须同时匹配频率和波矢
and momentum so you have to match up
both the frequency and the wave vector

262
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,429
声子的波矢中具有频率的光的唯一位置
of the light with the frequency in the
wave vector of a phonon the only place

263
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,139
可能发生的事情就在这里，您永远无法匹配的原因
that can happen is right here and the
reason you're never going to match the

264
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:16,710
声模，因为速度失配非常严重，但与光学
acoustic mode because the velocity
mismatches so badly but with the optical

265
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,850
因为光学模式即使在K等于零时也具有有限的频率，所以存在
mode since the optical mode has finite
frequency even at K equals zero there is

266
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,869
光学模式频率与光频率和光学模式相匹配的点
a point where the optical mode frequency
matches light frequency and the optical

267
00:27:24,869 --> 00:27:31,669
在这种情况下，模式动量与光动量甚至晶体动量匹配
mode momentum matches the light momentum
or even crystal momentum in this case

268
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:36,779
现在，这就是人们为什么称其为光学模式的名称
now so that's a nomenclature of where
why people call this the optical mode

269
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:40,440
每当您与光线和振动发生相互作用时， 
whenever you have interactions with
light and vibrations it's inevitably the

270
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:44,850
光学模式，但我应该诚实地说我所描述的过程
optical mode but I should be a little
bit honest that that process I described

271
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,950
给你吸收光子而发出声子的方式实际上并没有
to you by which you absorb a photon and
you emit a phonon actually does not

272
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,309
发生而没有发生的原因是因为有一个保守的量子
occur and the reason it doesn't occur is
because there's a conserved quantum

273
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:59,399
编号光子的自旋，我的意思是光子具有自旋声子
number the spin of the photon which I
mean photons have spin phonons do not so

274
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:02,519
如果要发生该过程，则会违反角动量
if that process to were to occur you
would violate angular momentum

275
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:06,210
保护，所以您绝对不想破坏
conservation so that's you know
definitely bad you don't want to violate

276
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:10,470
保持角质素，因此实际上不存在这样的过程
angular mentum conservation so in fact
no such process exists by which a single

277
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,639
光子被吸收并产生单个声子，但是还有更多
photon is absorbed and a single phonon
is created however there are more

278
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:19,110
可能发生涉及光子和声子的复杂过程
complicated processes that can occur
involving photons and phonons for

279
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:24,690
例如吸收两个光子并发射一些声子，因为这个角度
example absorb two photons and emit some
phonons that's okay because this angular

280
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:27,520
两个光子的动量可以抵消，你可以
momentum of the two photons can cancel
and you can

281
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,410
我们将有保护，这仍然是很难克服的相同原则
we'll have conservation and it's still
the same principle that is very hard to

282
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:37,330
在声子与声子之间的任何形式的相互作用中均能保持能量和动量
conserve both energy and momentum in any
sort of interaction between phonons and

283
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:40,480
光子，除非您需要进入光学模式，因为您需要
photons unless you're getting optical
modes into the game because you need to

284
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,200
通过声子以某种方式使高频进入游戏，因此唯一的方法
get high frequencies into the game
somehow with phonon so the only way to

285
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,280
用声子的小波矢获得高频是使用光学
get high frequencies with small wave
vectors in phonons is to use the optical

286
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,590
模式好吧，所以这个名字实际上来自更普遍的地方
mode okay so that's where the name comes
from actually more generally

287
00:28:53,590 --> 00:29:01,620
让我更一般地给Nam和Chur Chur讲声学模式
let me give more general Nam and clay
Chur here acoustic mode generally

288
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:13,450
声学模式是在小K且光与Omega成正比的任何模式
acoustic mode is any mode where Omega is
proportional to K at small K and optical

289
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:22,300
光学模式是欧米茄达到不等于常数的任何模式
mode optical mode is any mode where
Omega goes to a constant not equal to

290
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:30,700
在小K处为零好吧，让我们考虑一下这个小K体制
zero at small K okay let's think about
this this small K regime a little bit

291
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:38,440
更严重的是，我们发现本征值是频率，但让我们看一下
more seriously so we found the eigen
values the frequencies but let's look at

292
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,100
特征向量，所以我们实际上对角化的矩阵很大
the eigenvectors so the matrix we're
actually diagonalizing is that big

293
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,320
那里的矩阵，让我们看看它在K等于零，所以在K等于零
matrix there and let's look at it at K
equals zero so at K equals zero

294
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:52,090
我们感兴趣的矩阵的形式为
the matrix we're interested in is of the
form

295
00:29:52,090 --> 00:30:00,490
我猜它是负Kappa 1加Kappa 2乘以1负1负1 1 
I guess it's minus Kappa 1 plus Kappa 2
times what is it 1 minus 1 minus 1 1

296
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:06,310
那样的事情，还是我在错误的地方弄糟了，不，我想
something like that or do I get the
minuses in the wrong place no I think

297
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,500
没关系，所以看起来像这样，因为当波向量
it's right ok so it looks something like
this because when when the wave vector

298
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,420
变成0到i的指数e都变成1，所以你有一个矩阵
goes to 0 the Exponential's e to the i
ka both go to 1 and so you have a matrix

299
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:22,060
的形式是1 1减去1减去1 1（如果我拉出减去Kappa 1加Kappa 2） 
of the form 1 1 minus 1 minus 1 1 if I
pull out minus Kappa 1 plus Kappa 2 so

300
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:26,050
特征向量我们有两个可能的特征向量
the eigen vectors
we have two possible eigenvectors one is

301
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:34,830
对于欧米茄等于零的解，我们有一个特征向量ax ay等于1 1 
for the Omega equals zero solution we
have an eigen vector ax a y equals 1 1

302
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:41,740
至于光学模式解，另一个特征向量
where as for the the optical mode
solution the other eigen vector the high

303
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:51,070
能量高频本征向量，我们具有axay等于1减去1，所以
energy high frequency eigen vector we
have a x a y equals 1 minus 1 so what is

304
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:55,660
这告诉我们这是告诉我们的是对于k附近的声学模式
this telling us what this is telling us
is that for the acoustic mode near k

305
00:30:55,660 --> 00:31:00,790
等于0，原子实际上正在与它们的邻居一起移动， 
equals 0 the atoms are actually moving
with their neighbors that both of the

306
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:04,900
晶胞中的原子在同一时间向同一方向移动
atoms in the unit cell are moving the
same direction at the same time they're

307
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,970
同步移动，而对于光学模式，则为高频模式
moving in concert the whereas for the
optical mode the higher frequency mode

308
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,990
晶胞中的两个原子彼此相对移动， 
the two atoms in the unit cell are
moving opposite each other and it's

309
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:18,520
实际上很自然地解释了为什么光学模式如此
actually quite natural to explain then
why it is that the optical mode is so

310
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,820
频率要高得多，因为在光学模式下，您正在压缩
much higher in frequency because in
optical mode you're compressing the

311
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,570
最大弹起，而当声学模式下您几乎没有压缩
springs maximally whereas when the
acoustic mode you're hardly compressing

312
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:29,740
之所以如此，是因为每个人都朝着相同的方向前进
the springs at all because everyone is
moving in the same direction these sort

313
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:38,200
趋势的发生更普遍，如果存在
of trends occur more generally so
general if if there are m

314
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:48,960
如果晶胞中的晶胞原子中有m个原子，我们将有M个模式
if there are m atoms in the unit cell
atoms in unit cell we would have M modes

315
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:59,980
在每个K处，声学就是每个人都以相同的方式运动的模式
at each K one is acoustic that's the
mode where every one moves in the same

316
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:04,840
 K的方向等于零，则剩余的M减去其中之一为
direction at K equals zero and then the
remaining M minus one of them are

317
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:11,770
光学上的含义是，它们在k等于d时不等于0 
optical meaning they don't all move in
the same direction at k equals 0 in d

318
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:29,170
维度d维度在香港d每k有d次m个模
dimensions d dimensions there are d
times m modes at each k at HK d our

319
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:32,220
光学声
optic are acoustic

320
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:45,200
剩下的D乘以M减去1可以算是好的，为什么这是我们
and the remaining D times M minus 1 are
optical okay why is this well we're the

321
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,110
模式的总数是指度数的总数
total count of the modes is a total
count of the number of degrees of

322
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:53,600
自由，如果有M，则每个K的数目总是与数字相同
freedom if there are M there's always
the same number of K's per as the number

323
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,860
系统中的每个单元格的每个每个值具有M质量
of unit cells in the system each each
value of each unit cell has M masses in

324
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,260
它可以在D维度上移动，因此共有DM自由度
it and they can move in D dimensions so
there's a total of DM degrees of freedom

325
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:15,260
每个单元格，因此我们期望每个K的DM模式现在可以有d个
per unit cell so we expect DM modes for
each K now of them there can be d of

326
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,070
他们在那里声学，并对应于任何一个
them there acoustic and that corresponds
to all of the masses moving in any of

327
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:24,020
三个可能的方向，所以我们知道我们已经讨论了这些事情
the three possible directions so we know
what these things are we've discussed

328
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,040
它们中的一个是纵向的，而其中两个是横向的，所以对于
them before one of them is longitudinal
and two of them are transverse so for

329
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,970
每一个K都向K方向移动，然后其中两个是
each K one of them is moving in the
direction of K and then two of them are

330
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:38,090
在三个维度上垂直于K移动好一点
moving perpendicular to K in three
dimensions okay there's one more point

331
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:43,190
在这张照片上，我们可能会更仔细地看一下
on this picture that we could probably
look at more carefully which is these

332
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,770
此处有趣的点位于所谓的Braun自己的边界PI 
interesting points here near which are
at the so-called Braun's own boundary PI

333
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:57,680
让我把它放在这里，所以考虑考虑BZ边界BZ 
over a let me put it over here so
consider consider BZ boundary BZ

334
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:08,899
边界K等于a上的PI，那么我们有什么好呢，那么这个系数Kappa 
boundary K equals PI over a so what do
we have then well then this factor Kappa

335
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:18,320
 i kappa 1的2加e实际上是绝对k2减去k1，所以
2 plus e to the i ka Kappa 1 is actually
absolute k2 minus k1 and so the

336
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:26,510
 Ω平方的频率是m k1上的1加Kappa 1加Kappa 2正负
frequencies Omega squared is 1 over m k1
plus Kappa 1 plus Kappa 2 plus or minus

337
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:32,510
绝对Kappa 1减去Kappa 2或Kappa 2减去大写1并不重要
absolute Kappa 1 minus Kappa 2 or Kappa
2 minus Capital one doesn't matter its

338
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:38,179
绝对值，这意味着我们有两个可能的解决方案，欧米茄等于
absolute value and that means that we
have two possible solutions Omega equals

339
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:44,000
 m上的2 kappa 1的平方根或2 kappa 2的平方根
either square root of 2 kappa 1 over m
or square root of 2 Kappa 2

340
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,270
在em上，因此我们将其标记在这里，因此该称呼2的平方根为1 
over em so we'll mark them here so this
one will call square root of 2 capital 1

341
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:56,510
超过m，这个将称2为m的2 Kappa 2的平方根
over m and this one will call square
root of 2 Kappa 2 over m and here I've

342
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,760
假设资本1大于Kappa 2，否则更高
assumed that capital 1 is greater than
Kappa 2 otherwise around the higher

343
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,910
能量永远是最重要的，这些模式实际上永远不会相互交叉
energy one is always on top and these
modes actually never cross each other

344
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:11,840
您可以通过查看这些频率的形式来说服自己
you can convince yourself by looking at
the form of the the frequency that these

345
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,520
两种模式实际上无法交叉，所以在这个青铜器上发生了什么
two modes can never actually cross so
what's going on at this at this bronze

346
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:24,980
自身边界位于青铜器自身边界处，波形Delta X Delta y等于ax 
own boundary at the bronze own boundary
the wave form Delta X Delta y equals ax

347
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:33,590
为什么将e代入IΩ减去负IK，再将这e代至负IK和a 
a why e to the I Omega T e to the minus
I K and a this e to the minus I K and a

348
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:39,850
变成N的负1，这告诉我们发生了什么
becomes minus 1 to the N and that tells
us that what's going on is that

349
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:44,330
备用单位晶格彼此异相移动
alternate unit cells are moving out of
phase with each other they're moving in

350
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:48,440
彼此相反的方向，所以现在看看是否可以使它起作用
the opposite direction as each other so
now it's see if we can get this to work

351
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:59,980
哦，不，不，不，停止，停止，停止，停止
oh no no no stop stop stop sets of stop

352
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:05,750
没有
No

353
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:18,500
哦，亲爱的，这仅在星期一发生，所以我们在这里进行筛选哦，但是那是在
oh dear does this happen only on Monday
so here we go screen up oh but that's on

354
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,160
哦，哇，好极了，所以我们仍然可以在它进行的同时做这件事，所以这
oh wow amazing okay so we can still do
this while it's going on okay so this

355
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,980
程序是由Mike Glazer编写的，您可以单击交替
program is the thing written by by Mike
Glazer and you can click alternating

356
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,360
链条和纵向纵向意味着一切都在
chain and longitudinal longitudinal
means that everything oscillates in the

357
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,840
单行，您可以通过更改此滑块在此处更改K，您可以看到
single line you can change the K here by
changing this slider and you can see

358
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,610
色散在下方绘制，从零到2pi 
that the the dispersion is plotted down
here it's plotted from zero to 2pi

359
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:49,160
而不是零而不是负PI超过零到2pi而不是a 
instead of a zero instead of minus PI
over zero to 2pi over a instead of minus

360
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,020
我在这里画的像是2pi上的PI，所以它是同一张图片
PI over a 2pi over a like I've drawn
here so it's the same picture so first

361
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:58,670
让我们从非常小的K开始，哦，还有这些
let's start by taking K very very small
oh and also you have these little

362
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,810
咔嗒声在这里，这将改变弹簧的质量，让我们
clickers up here which will change the
masses on the springs let's make the

363
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,860
质量是相同的，而c1和c2或我们称之为两者的Capital One和Kappa 
mass is the same and c1 and c2 or what
we call Capital One and Kappa to the two

364
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:11,870
弹簧常数，所以我们有两个不同的弹簧常数大写N和
spring constants so we have two
different spring constants capital N and

365
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:15,980
卡伯（Kappa）-这里是声学模式的分散，这里是光学模式
Kappa - and here's the dispersion the
acoustic mode down here the optical mode

366
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:19,430
在这里，我们单击了声学，所以我们实际上看到了声学模式
up here here we've clicked acoustic so
we're seeing actually the acoustic mode

367
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:23,360
在这里，您会看到声学模式的频率非常低，基本上
here and you see that the acoustic mode
is very low frequency and basically all

368
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,110
让我们将其向上移动一点，以便它可以更快地发生
of the let's move this up a little bit
so it happens a little faster you can

369
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:32,150
看到基本上所有的群众都在互相配合
see that basically all the masses are
moving in concert with each other sort

370
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,610
缓慢的来回晃动的水动力振荡
of slow sloshing back and forth
hydrodynamic oscillations you can sort

371
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:42,500
当您知道一个巨大的流体时，如果
of viewed as you know one big fluid
everything sort of moves together now if

372
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,640
我们去K等于零，它变成零频率，但我们可以在这里单击光学
we go to K equals zero it becomes zero
frequency but we can click on optic here

373
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,990
我们将得到光学模式，您会看到光学模式是每个质量运动的
and we'll get the optical mode you see
the optical mode is each mass moving

374
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:55,520
与晶胞中的其他质量相对，您可以看到这是
opposite the other mass in the unit cell
you can see that this is something that

375
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,210
应该是高频的，因为它现在最大程度地压缩弹簧
should be high frequency because it's
compressing the springs maximally now if

376
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:09,500
然后我们将K向量更改为bronz自己的边界，我们在这里是
we then change the K vector to the bronz
own boundary what we have here is is as

377
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:16,670
预测备用晶胞彼此相对移动，因此
predicted that the alternate unit cells
are moving opposite each other so this

378
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,310
单位质量，这两个质量与这两个质量相反，因此您可以
unit cell these two masses are moving
opposite of these two masses and you can

379
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,050
看看为什么它只是两个弹簧常数之一
see actually why it is
only one of the two spring constants

380
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:31,120
进入频率，因为这两个质量之间的弹簧实际上
enters in the frequency because the
spring between these two masses actually

381
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,420
完全没有压缩，只是晶胞之间的弹簧
isn't getting compressed at all it's
only the spring between the unit cells

382
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,720
被压缩，而不是晶胞内的弹簧
that are getting compressed and not the
spring within the unit cell that's

383
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,250
现在，如果您切换到压缩模式，请从以下位置开始压缩： 
getting compressed now if you switch
then from looking at the optical mode at

384
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,340
区域边界到区域边界的声学模式看起来非常好
the zone boundary to the acoustic mode
of the zone boundary it looks extremely

385
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,300
类似，但这里的频率较低，但您会注意到这是另一个春天
similar but it's a lower frequency here
but you'll notice it's the other spring

386
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,350
现在被压缩了，仍然知道一个单元格正在移动
that's now getting compressed it's still
you know you have one unit cell moving

387
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,370
在一个方向上另一个单位晶格朝相反的方向移动，但现在
in one direction another unit cell
moving in the opposite direction but now

388
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,530
是相反的弹簧k2弹簧被压缩，而不是
it's the opposite spring the k2 spring
which is being compressed rather than

389
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:09,390
 Kappa一个弹簧被压缩好了，所以我强烈建议人们
the Kappa one spring being compressed
okay so I highly recommend that people

390
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,330
下载此程序并弄乱它，还有很多其他乐趣
download this program and mess around
with it it's got a lot of other fun

391
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:17,920
这就是我们在无聊的星期六晚上可以做的事情或可以的事情
features this is what we can do on a
boring Saturday night or something okay

392
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:27,310
所以让我在这里重画这张照片，或者也许再停止一遍
so let me redraw this picture here or
maybe maybe stop this for a second okay

393
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:32,590
在这里重画这张图片好吧，我不知道为什么它仍然还在做
redraw this picture here all right I
don't know why it's still still doing

394
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:41,860
那好吧好吧，让我重画这张照片，除了我要
that but okay all right good let me
redraw this picture except I'm going to

395
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:49,480
略有不同，这里又是K，这是欧米茄，我要
draw slightly differently
here's K again here's Omega I'm going to

396
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:57,970
将PI放在此处，并将PI减去在此处，然后将两个PI放在此处和
put PI over a here and minus PI over a
here and then two PI over a here and

397
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:02,890
然后减去8的两个PI，我将绘制声学模式
then minus two PI over eight here I'm
going to draw the acoustic mode just

398
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:07,660
就像我以前拥有过的一样，然后我们以前拥有的光学模式是
like I had it before and then the
optical mode what we had before was

399
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:14,770
看起来像这样的东西，但我完全可以拿走这块
something that looked like this but I'm
perfectly allowed to take this piece

400
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:24,670
在这里，将其在a上移动两个pi，然后在此处进行绘制就可以了
here and shift it by two pi over a and
plot it instead here okay

401
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,180
所以我要做的就是拿走了这件作品，然后将它移了两个pi来移动它
so all I did was I took this piece and I
shifted it by two pi over a to move it

402
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,920
在这里，然后我可以在这里拿走这部分，并通过这种方式将其转移到PI 
over here and then I can take this piece
here and shift it to PI over a this way

403
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:38,030
放在这里，所以现在我要抹去我认识的人
and put it here
so now I'm going to erase I know people

404
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,640
当您进行一系列转换时会讨厌中间的部分
hate when you do a race of transforms
going to raise the piece in the middle

405
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,630
我要把这些碎片留在这里
and I'm going to leave these pieces here
so this piece and have this piece

406
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:52,520
好吧，所以拿了这块，并以这种方式将它移动了2pi 
okay so just took this piece and moved
it by 2pi over a this way and this piece

407
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:57,260
以2pi的方式移动，现在我以这种方式在这里得到这张照片
moved by 2pi over a that way and I got
this picture here now this way of

408
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:05,570
绘制事物被称为扩展区域游戏扩展区域方案，它
drawing things is known as the extended
zones game extended zone scheme and it

409
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:10,220
有一个很好的优点，就是只有一个凯，每个只有一个模式
has a nice advantage that there is only
one Kay there's only one mode at each

410
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:16,250
在h波向量k处的频率，因此在这里，每个波都有两种模式
frequency at h wave vector k so whereas
over here we have two modes at each wave

411
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,260
向量k在这里我们只有一个，但是我们使用了两倍的k范围， 
vector k here we only have one but we've
used twice as much range of k and that

412
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:27,530
有时方便地做一些命名，这在此范围内很有用
sometimes convenient to to do just some
nomenclature which is useful this range

413
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:38,540
这里被称为第一个拥有自己的青铜器的青铜器，这里被称为该地区
here is known as the first bronze own
bronze own and this region here is known

414
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:45,170
作为这里的第二个青铜人，这里也是第二个青铜人
as the second bronze own along with this
region here second bronze own so we took

415
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:49,220
光学模式，我们将其从第一个青铜器中移出并放入
the optical mode and we moved it out of
the first bronze own and put it into the

416
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,780
扩展区域方案拥有的第二个青铜器，以这种方式画图
second bronze own for the extended zone
scheme this way of drawing things over

417
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,850
与扩展区相比
here
in comparison to the extended zone

418
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:01,250
该方案被称为减少区域方案，因为一切都已经
scheme is known as the reduced zone
scheme because everything has been

419
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:10,490
现在变成一个铜牌了，为什么这么方便
reduced into a single bronze own now why
is it that it's so convenient to to

420
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:16,910
展开所有东西，以便每个波矢处只有一个模式
spread everything out so that there's
only one mode at each wave vector well a

421
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:21,670
假设这样做非常有用的情况是以下情况
case where this becomes extremely useful
to do is the following case suppose

422
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:28,070
认为Capital One非常接近Kappa 2 
consider Capital One very close to Kappa
2

423
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:33,230
所以在这种情况下，将会发生的是
so in that case what's going to happen
is that these this little gap here is

424
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,550
会变得非常小，所以让我们看看发生了什么
going to get extremely small so let's
see what that happened what that looks

425
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:48,050
就像这样，这里是K，这里是PI，而这里的PI是两个PI 
like so here's K here's PI over a
there's two pi over a here's minus PI

426
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:52,040
超过a，而这里的负两个pi，因此
over a
and here's minus two pi over a so it's

427
00:42:52,040 --> 00:43:02,570
看起来像是这样的，这样的缝隙很小
going to look like is kind of this that
like this like that so a very small gap

428
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:06,770
在这里是青铜的边界，因为首都一号和卡帕二号非常接近
at the bronze own boundary here because
Capital One and Kappa two are very close

429
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:12,619
现在彼此交流当Capital One实际上等于Kappa时会发生什么
to each other now what happens when
Capital One actually equals Kappa - well

430
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:17,420
那么我们所拥有的就是差距缩小，它变成了一条单独的连接线
then what we have is the gap closes it
becomes a single single connected line

431
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:23,660
但更重要的是我们恢复了单原子链
but more importantly we recover the
monatomic chain right

432
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,340
如果Capital One等于Kappa，那么每个质量和每个春天都是相同的
if Capital One equals Kappa - then every
mass and every every spring is the same

433
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:31,160
因为每隔一个春天每个质量都与每个其他春天相同，所以我们得到
as every other spring every mass is the
same as every other spring so we get

434
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:37,280
返回单原子链，但是晶格常数改变了新的晶格
back the monatomic chain but the lattice
constant has changed the new lattice

435
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,359
常数仅是旧晶格常数的一半，因为白色和
constant is only half as big as the old
lattice constant because the white and

436
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,119
现在黑球质量实际上是相同的，它们现在是相同的对象，所以我们
black ball mass is now actually are the
same they're the same object now so we

437
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,609
不必用两件事来制作一个晶胞，我们现在只用一个
don't have to make a unit cell with two
things we now make a unit cell with only

438
00:43:52,609 --> 00:44:01,730
一件事是对的，所以棕熊拥有铜牌，而BZ现在的范围是K 
one thing in it right so the Bruins own
the bronze own the BZ now ranges from K

439
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:09,980
是从负数从质数的PI变为质数好的PI，这是相同的
is goes from minus PI over a prime to PI
over a prime okay and that is the same

440
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:19,850
因为2 PI超过负2 PI超过2 2 PI超过了OK，所以这里的整个范围为1 
as 2 PI over a minus 2 PI over a 2 2 PI
over a ok so this entire range here 1 if

441
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:24,859
这两个质量变得相同这整个范围成为第一个
the two masses become the same this
entire range here becomes the first

442
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:34,010
青铜拥有第一个单原子链的BZ，然后如果
bronze own first BZ of monatomic chain
monatomic chain and then if you make

443
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:39,619
 Capital One和Kappa会使您在新产品方面稍有差距
Capital One and Kappa to slightly
unequal you open a small gap at the new

444
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:45,410
熊在PI上拥有自己的界限，但实际上底层是一个
Bruins own boundaries at PI over a ok
but really what's underlying is a single

445
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,720
从这里到这里，从这里到这里，单原子链的模式
mode for the monatomic chain from here
to here and here to here just a single

446
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,080
连接模式，当您将大写N和Kappa设为两个时，您将打开make 
connected mode and you open up if make
when you make capital N and Kappa two

447
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,210
稍有不同，您会在自己的铜牌上开一个小缺口
slightly different you open up a small
gap at the bronze own at the bronze own

448
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,240
与新的较小的青铜合金的边界与新的较大的晶胞相关联
boundary with the new smaller bronze own
associated with the new larger unit cell

449
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:10,809
好吧，好吧好吧，在最后几分钟我想讨论一个完全不同的问题
okay happy okay in the last few minutes
I want to discuss a completely different

450
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:14,890
话题，我们没有，我们没到上次，那是我们的时间
topic something we didn't we didn't get
to last time which was our the time

451
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:19,839
在范德华（van der Waals）结合之前，您可能还记得这个家伙
before which is van der Waals bonding
van der waals you may remember this guy

452
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:23,530
根据您可能已经在统计中研究的范德华斯状态方程
from the van der Waals equation of state
that you've probably studied in a stat

453
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:30,670
机械范德华力键也称为分子键
mech van der Waals bonds also known as
molecular bonds molecular or fluctuating

454
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:43,599
偶极波动偶极键，这些是范德华键
dipole fluctuating dipole bonds bonds
and these are van der Waals bonds are

455
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,740
实际上与离子或共价或氢或
actually quite different from either
ionic or covalent or hydrogen or

456
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:53,020
金属键，从某种意义上说，这些键是针对非活性化学物而发生的
metallic bonds in the sense that these
bonds occur for inactive chemical

457
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:01,569
活跃物种中的物种，我所说的非活跃物种是
species in active species and what I
mean by inactive species is that no

458
00:46:01,569 --> 00:46:07,480
电子在原子之间转移没有原子之间共享电子
electron is transferred between atoms no
electron is shared between atoms things

459
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,440
像稀有气体是范德华力键合的经典案例，稀有气体具有
like noble gases are classic cases of
Vander Waals bonding the noble gas has a

460
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,369
充满的外壳，它不共享电子，不捐赠
filled shell it doesn't share its
electrons it doesn't donate its

461
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:17,950
电子，它不共价键，它不
electrons
it doesn't covalently bond it doesn't

462
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:23,740
离子键，但它仍然可以范德华力键，这是另一个
ionically bond but it can still Van der
Waals bond now another example of an

463
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:29,290
非活性物质是分子，例如氮2本身就是一个原子
inactive species are molecules such as
nitrogen 2 nitrogen by itself as an atom

464
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,160
是非常活跃的，但是当您将两个氮原子放在一起时，它们会形成一个
is very active but when you put two
nitrogen atoms together they form a

465
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,160
极惰性的氮分子，您可以认为它是
nitrogen molecule which is extremely
inactive you can think of it as being

466
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,280
填充的分子壳的填充壳，一旦拥有，它也不会共享
filled shell of a filled molecular shell
and it also does not share once you have

467
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,609
分子分子非常稳定，不与电子共享
the molecule the molecule is very stable
it doesn't share its electrons with

468
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:50,369
其他什么也不会把电子捐给其他任何东西
anything else and it doesn't donate its
electrons to anything else so

469
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:53,920
尽管如此，即使您不捐赠电子或移动电子
nonetheless even though you're not
donating electrons or moving electrons

470
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,490
周围仍然可以用尽空间，但仍然可以形成一种纽带
around you can still running out of
space you can still form a bond the way

471
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:07,390
发生这种结合的情况如下，想像您说的是一个很好的稀有气体原子
the bond occurs is as follows imagine
that you have say a nice noble gas atom

472
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:13,390
在这里，也许还有另一个很好的稀有气体原子，我想
over here and maybe another nice noble
gas atom over here and I suppose at some

473
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:17,890
当亚当有一些偶极子向量p1 a时
moment the
Adam has some dipole vector p1 a

474
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:24,550
极化现在，如果您记得从您的enm离开R的距离， 
polarization now if you remember from
your enm a distance R away there will be

475
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:28,600
由偶极矩引起的电场在这种情况下指向
an electric field due to that dipole
moment in this case pointing in that

476
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:39,400
方向和e在4个PI epsilon零R的立方上等于p1 
direction and e will be equal to minus
p1 over 4 PI epsilon naught R cubed and

477
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,600
如果是我以不同的角度绘制角度，我便方便地选择R为
if it was if I had drawn the angles
differently I conveniently chose R to be

478
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:48,190
垂直于那一刻，但如果我不使它们垂直
perpendicular to the moment there but if
I didn't make them perpendicular there'd

479
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,780
是一些余弦，正弦之类的东西，像我现在要忽略的东西
be some cosines and sines and stuff like
that which I'm leaving out now when this

480
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:58,630
原子经历此电场会产生极化，并得到
atom experiences this electric field it
develops a polarization it gets an

481
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:05,410
感应极化P 2这是Chi恒定的时间e这是
induced polarization P 2 which is Chi
some constant times e this is this

482
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:11,350
常数在这里称为极化率极化率或
constant here is known as the
polarizability polarizability or

483
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:15,270
电敏感性
electric susceptibility electric

484
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,310
像氢这样的敏感原子，您可以计算出您知道的磁化率
susceptible atoms like hydrogen you can
calculate the susceptibility you know

485
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:28,450
微扰理论甚至可以将其作为运动
perturbation Theory maybe even done that
as an exercise as an exercise in the

486
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:31,420
他们要求你使用量子力学做到这一点
book they asked you to do that using
quantum mechanics

487
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:35,980
无论如何，现在我们有两个偶极矩，你会记得
anyway now what we have is we have two
dipole moments and you'll remember that

488
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:42,880
两个偶极矩的能量在4 PIε零R上为负P 1 P 2 
the energy of two dipole moments is
minus P 1 P 2 over 4 PI epsilon naught R

489
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,280
求立方，这样总能量就可以将这些东西塞在一起
cubed so the total energy is then just
plugging these things all together

490
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:56,740
我们得到减去4个PI epsilon的负P 1平方PI零R将所有平方和
we get minus P 1 squared PI over 4 PI
epsilon naught R cubed all squared and

491
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:03,940
特别是这是负数，R等于第六，所以力等于1 
in particular this is negative and goes
as R to the sixth so the force goes as 1

492
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:09,400
从R到第七，这或多或少是您如何计算的
over R to the seventh now that's more or
less how the calculation goes that you

493
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,730
具有一个原子的极化，它会引起另一个原子的极化， 
have a polarization one atom it induces
a polarization in the other atom and

494
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:16,869
他们的两极分化很吸引人，但您可能会说，请等一秒钟
they the polarization is attract but you
might say well wait a second this whole

495
00:49:16,869 --> 00:49:22,810
争论的依据是两极化不等于
argument was predicated on the statement
that the polarization is not equal to

496
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,440
从零开始，但在球对称原子上
zero to begin with but on a spherically
symmetric atom like

497
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:33,140
氦极化的期望为零为什么那么好
helium the expectation of the
polarization is zero why is that well

498
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:37,940
你还记得一个原子的极化这里是原子核这里是
you remember that the polarization of an
atom here's the nucleus here's the

499
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:44,780
电子以某种球形轨道绕原子运行
electron electrons running around the
atom in some sort of spherical orbit so

500
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:50,329
电子的位置R仅与极化有关
the position R of the electron is
related to the polarization just by

501
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:55,339
减去e乘以R或类似的数字，所以实际上我们只是在说
minus e times R or something like that
so it's really we're just saying that

502
00:49:55,339 --> 00:50:00,650
电子的平均位置实际上是零，但是您会注意到
the average position of the electron is
actually at zero but you'll notice that

503
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,520
实际上，这个方程式不是极化或偶极子
what actually comes into this equation
is not the polarization or the dipole

504
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:11,140
矩P，但是它是P平方，所以P平方不等于零，所以你可以得到
moment P but it's P squared so P squared
is not equal to zero so that you can get

505
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:17,569
即使平均偶极矩为零，非零偶极引力
nonzero dipolar attractive force even
though the average dipole moment is zero

506
00:50:17,569 --> 00:50:20,390
如果您想考虑一下，就知道波动和量子力学是
if you like to think about you know
fluctuations and quantum mechanics as

507
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:24,619
是某种动态波动或时间波动， 
being some sort of dynamical fluctuation
or fluctuation in time what we really

508
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:28,550
意思是说，这是一种课程图或什么的粗略图
mean is that at it's a sort of a course
picture or a crude picture of what

509
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,270
量子力学是，但您可以将其视为某个时候
quantum mechanics is but you can sort of
think of it as at some moment in time

510
00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,349
电子在原子核的一侧，所以有一个偶极矩
the electron is on one side of the
nucleus so there's a dipole moment the

511
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,220
另一个原子对此做出反应，而东方的偶极矩则相反
other atom responds to that and Orient's
its dipole moment in the opposite

512
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:45,609
方向，然后他们吸引，然后在以后的某个时间出现一个问题
direction then they attract and then at
some later time there's a question

513
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,559
是的，如果小便之间有角度，那是说如果有一个角度
yeah if there's an angle between pee
you're saying that if there's an angle

514
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:59,309
在p1到p2之间​​会有余弦Thetas等等，类似的东西
between p1 to p2 there would be cosine
Thetas and so forth and things like that

515
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,960
是的，但是在力量仍然具有吸引力的地方，实际上
yeah but that where the force will still
be attractive you can actually there's

516
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:07,020
书中有一个练习可以帮助您完成练习，并且您可以
there's an exercise in the book that
works you through it and you can and you

517
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:10,680
可以使所有角度正确，并且总是会出现有吸引力的好问题
can get all the angles right and it will
always come out attractive good question

518
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:15,530
但不值巧克力棒，所以还是个好问题，谢谢
but not worth the chocolate bar so but
it's still a good question thank you

519
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:22,799
无论如何，所以基本上你在一个原子上会有一点波动
anyway the so it's basically you get a
little bit of a fluctuation on one atom

520
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:26,160
它引起另一个原子的波动，它们吸引，无论是哪个原子
it causes a fluctuation the other atom
and they attract and no matter which

521
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,710
方向波动是响应波动在
direction the fluctuation is the
responding fluctuation is in the

522
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,859
相反的方向，他们总是吸引，所以你仍然可以得到一个非零
opposite direction and they always
attract so you can still get a nonzero

523
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:35,640
范德华力没有范德华力比共价离子弱得多
Van der Waals force no the van der Waals
force is much weaker than covalent ionic

524
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:41,880
或氢键，但它仍然足够强到可以引起诸如
or hydrogen bond but it's still strong
enough to cause important effects such

525
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:46,559
如您所知，它可以将低温下的氩气和
as you know you know it holds together
things like argon at low temperature and

526
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,539
当氩气变成固体时，范德华斯更有趣
when argon becomes a solid a more
interesting case of where van der Waals

527
00:51:51,539 --> 00:51:56,190
如果你去过热带气候，部队就会和这个家伙在一起
forces show up is with this guy if
you've ever been to tropical climate

528
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,150
这是壁虎的小蜥蜴，他们也出售汽车保险
this this is a gecko a little lizard
they also they sell car insurance in the

529
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:03,869
美国我不知道为什么这是事实，这是美国的吉祥物
United States I don't I don't know why
that's true this is the mascot of the

530
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:11,099
壁虎Geico壁虎公司无论如何壁虎是惊人的小动物
Gecko Geico gecko company anyway
geckos are amazing little creatures

531
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:15,960
因为它们可以爬上几乎完全平坦的玻璃墙而没有
because they can crawl up almost
completely flat glass walls with no

532
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,010
根本没有麻烦，实际上把它们粘在墙上的东西变成了
trouble at all and the thing that
actually sticks them to the wall turns

533
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:23,490
成为范德华力，他们让你知道他们的脚很扁平， 
out to be Van der Waals forces they have
you know they have very flat foot and

534
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:27,599
他们将脚踩在玻璃上，并且有足够的范德华力
they stick their foot onto the glass and
there's enough van der Waals force

535
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,869
在他们的脚和玻璃之间，它们是相当轻的小动物
between their foot and the glass and
they're fairly light little creatures

536
00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:34,589
他们实际上可以走到墙上，因为那很好，我向我道歉
that they can actually walk up the wall
