1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,540
因此，当参加浓缩物课程的第18讲时，以及
so when out to the 18th lecture of the
condensed matter course and and over the

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,330
最近几周，我们一直在积累有关
last couple weeks
we've been building up our knowledge of

3
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,780
如何了解固体中的电子我们知道关于能带结构的知识
how to understand electrons in solids we
know about band structure we know of

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,230
我们知道的电子和空穴就像有效物质一样，我们知道关于掺杂
electrons and holes we know about like
effective masses we know about doping

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,359
在这一点上，我们实际上已经获得了足够的知识，我们可以
and at this point we actually have
arrived at enough knowledge that we can

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,320
实际考虑将材料组合在一起以制造真实的设备
actually think about putting together
materials in order to make real devices

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,080
尤其是半导体器件
and in particular semiconductor devices
semiconductor devices which is in some

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,480
凝聚态物理整个领域的最高荣耀是
way the the crowning glory of the entire
field of condensed matter physics it's

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,149
因为我们可以制造半导体设备，例如
because we can make semiconductor
devices that we can build things like

10
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,870
我们可以制造手机的计算机，我们可以制造iPad以及其他所有这些
computers we can build cell phones we
can build iPads and and all these other

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,350
我们认为理所当然的事情，并且完全改变了我们您所知道的方式
things that we take for granted and
completely change our you know the way

12
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,410
这几天我们活着都是因为我们了解半导体物理学
we live these days it's all because we
understand semiconductor physics

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,010
很好的消息是，这完全不是可检查的，但是
extremely well the good news is that
it's totally not examinable but that

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,739
意味着我们不能坏消息是意味着我们不能花费很多时间
means that we can't the bad news is that
means we can't spend a whole lot of time

15
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,100
即使这是一个非常有趣的主题，您也可以花费
on it even though it's extremely
interesting subject you could spend you

16
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,010
知道您一生的剩余时间来研究半导体器件，并且
know the rest of your entire life
studying semiconductor devices and

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,880
建立新的，也许有人在这个房间里真的会
building new ones and probably some
people in this room really will the the

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,150
半导体行业是一个巨大的行业，拥有许多
semiconductor industry is a huge
industry that employs many many

19
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,630
物理学家，所以人们会思考
physicists so people will be thinking
about semiconductor devices in the

20
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,670
未来，我保证你会有人，但对我们来说，它将限于40 
future I promise you someone will but
for us it's gonna be limited to about 40

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,490
分钟，但我们将看到40分钟内可以到达的距离
minutes but we'll see how far we can get
in 40 minutes

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,939
所以我们要讨论的最简单的半导体器件是量子
so the simplest semiconductor device
we're going to discuss is the quantum

23
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:37,110
好吧，无非就是一种材料夹在另一种材料中的三明治
well which is nothing more than a a
sandwich of one material inside another

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,290
材料，所以您想象这里有三层材料
material so you imagine having a three
layer material over here it's over here

25
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,909
我们将砷化铝放在这里是砷化镓，这里是铝
we'll put aluminum arsenide here is
gallium arsenide and here's aluminum

26
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:51,630
砷化物，所以在我们这面是砷化铝之间的薄层镓
arsenide so it's a thin layer gallium on
our side in between aluminum arsenide

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,340
这是X的一些位置坐标，我们实际上已经研究了这种材料
this is X some position coordinate and
we've actually studied this material

28
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,030
在砷化镓之前，记得它是具有锌混合结构的
before gallium arsenide and remember it
was a it has zinc blende structure it's

29
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:04,380
具有砷化铝基础的FCC就像砷化镓一样，除了
FCC with the basis aluminum arsenide is
just like gallium arsenide except you

30
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,598
用新的铝代替镓，所以也有FCC和基础
replace the gallium with a new aluminum
so it's also FCC with basis and the

31
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,230
选择这些材料的原因是我们的砷化铝镓
reason that chosen these these materials
aluminum arsenide gallium ours

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,819
实际上，这里有一点大自然的恩赐
is actually the there's a little bit of
a gift of nature here it turns out that

33
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,879
砷化镓和晶格常数的晶格常数
the lattice constant the size of the
unit cell for gallium arsenide and

34
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,830
砷化铝极其精确地相同
aluminum arsenide is extremely extremely
precisely the same it's just something

35
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,250
随机发生，使这些非常理想的材料可用于
that randomly occurs which makes these
very desirable materials to work with

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,310
使事情变得非常理想的原因是意味着您可以排队
the reason that makes things very
desirable is means that you can line up

37
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:36,209
直接位于砷化镓和砷化铝之间的原子，以及
the atoms directly between the gallium
arsenide and the aluminum arsenide and

38
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,989
基本上只有一个巨型水晶，当您穿过水晶时， 
basically have just one giant crystal
and as you walk through the crystal the

39
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,410
唯一改变的是从这种材料到所有材料
only thing that changes is in going from
this material to this material all the

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,970
铝被镓秘密地取代了x'好，所以看起来就像一个
aluminum's get secretly replaced with
gallium x' ok so it just looks like one

41
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:52,500
一种材料的大晶体，但是在这里有铝
big crystal of one material but and over
here you have aluminum's here you have

42
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,650
镓新材料回到这里，铝又是
gallium xin the new back here and it's
aluminum's again the difference between

43
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,290
不同的材料是砷化铝中的带隙实际上是
the different materials is that the
bandgap in aluminum arsenide is actually

44
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,769
比砷化镓中的带隙大，所以您可能会有一个带
bigger than the bandgap in gallium
arsenide so you might have a band

45
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,000
像这样的结构这里是大带隙这里是小带隙
structure that looks like this it's big
band gap out here small band gap here

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,190
这里的带隙很大，所以如果我们绘制导带能量，则每次导通
big band gap here so if we plot the
conduction band energy each conduction

47
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:20,010
它会在这里很大，然后在这个区域掉落，这就是
it will be big here then it drops down
in this region here which is known as

48
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,389
量子阱，然后又回到这里，所以这是铝
the quantum well and then it comes back
up over here so this is the aluminum

49
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,569
砷化物这里是砷化镓这里是砷化铝
arsenide here's the gallium arsenide
here's the aluminum arsenide so if

50
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:32,010
你是一个生活在该导带中的电子，你所看到的是你
you're an electron living in that
conduction band what you see is you

51
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,700
基本上看到了某种约束力，例如
basically see a well some sort of
confining potential like a particle in

52
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,709
框，您将通常在框内的那个粒子中形成波动函数
box and you would form a wave function
in that particle in a box in the usual

53
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:44,340
当然，您也可以在其中激发状态波功能
way and of course you could have excited
state wave functions also in that

54
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,239
盒子里的颗粒也是这种和那种之间的唯一区别
particle in a box also the only
difference between this and the kind of

55
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,180
盒子中的粒子您在量子力学课程中解决的问题
particle in a box problems that you
solved in your quantum mechanics courses

56
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,579
就是如果M星不是M，则电子的有效质量为
is that if the M star not M the
effective mass of the electron is

57
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:59,970
重要的是，电子在导带中的有效质量是
important the effective mass of the
electron in the conduction band is the

58
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,810
缩短方程中显示的重要内容不是
important thing that shows up in the
shorteners equation not be real mass of

59
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,260
电子和其他不同的是X的V 
the electron and the other thing that's
different is that this V of X this

60
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:14,630
电位实际上是由于带结构所致
potential is actually due to the band
structure due to band structure

61
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:21,769
这就是导致电位在底部上升和下降的原因
so that's what's causing the potential
to go up and down at the bottom of the

62
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:25,970
如果您考虑一下，导带现在正在上下移动
conduction band is moving is moving up
and down now if you think about the

63
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:29,930
价带，实际上看起来相反
valence band
it actually looks the opposite the

64
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,980
价带价价带的顶部从低开始，直到高
valence band valence the top of the
valence band starts low it was up high

65
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,980
在中间，然后像这样回落，如果你整个生活
in the middle and then comes back down
like this and if you are a whole living

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,250
在价带中，记住孔要向上爬
in the valence band
remember the holes try to go up instead

67
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,240
像电子一样下降的尝试试图下降，因此实际上可以得到一个空穴
of coming down like electrons try to
come down so in fact a hole can get

68
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,520
卡在这种颠倒的井中，它也将形成一个特殊的盒子
stuck in this sort of upside-down well
and it would also form a particular box

69
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,410
该量子阱内部的波函数，因此您可以将两个电子都俘获
wavefunction inside inside this quantum
well so you can trap both an electron up

70
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,490
在这里和这里的一个洞现在实际上已经非常使用了这种非常简单的结构
here and a hole down here now this very
simple structure is actually used quite

71
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:05,150
在半导体行业中经常用于制造
frequently in in the semiconductor
industry very frequently for making

72
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,930
激光会发生什么，你想象在这里放一个电子和一个洞
lasers what happens is you imagine
putting an electron up here and a hole

73
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:14,200
在这里，然后电子可以在发射光子的同时落入该孔
down here and then an electron can fall
into that hole while emitting a photon

74
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,950
结果出来了，如果您上学了一些激光物理学，就知道如何
it comes out and if you learn some laser
physics last term you understand how if

75
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,760
你有这样的过渡，你可以建立，你可以从中建立激光器
you have transitions like this you can
build you can build lasers out of them

76
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,080
关于这种结构整洁的是，您可以改变能量
the thing that's neat about this
structure is you can change the energy

77
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,919
通过改变孔的宽度来改变本征态
of the eigenstates by changing the width
of the well so if you make it a thinner

78
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,680
在砷化铝里面的砷化镓里面的一层
layer in inside this of gallium arsenide
inside aluminum arsenide then the the

79
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,190
能量本征态发生变化仅仅是因为能量本征态始终取决于
energy eigenstates change just because
the energy eigenstates always depend on

80
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,840
盒子的宽度，因此您可以通过以下方式调节即将发出的声子的能量
the width of the box and so you can tune
the energy of the outcoming phonon by

81
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,200
只是改变孔的宽度，这就是为什么这种设备
just changing the width of the well and
that's why this kind of device is

82
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,820
经常在光电子学中使用好吧，所以这是最简单的
frequently used in optoelectronics okay
all right so this is a very simplest

83
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,940
我们需要考虑的设备，我们不必担心任何掺杂剂
device that we ever need to think about
we don't have to worry about any dopants

84
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,770
现在我们要考虑添加掺杂剂，这将使我们能够
now we're going to think about adding
dopants which when it will enable us to

85
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,539
制造一些更复杂的设备，因此掺杂，尽管我在
make some much more complicated devices
so doping and although I said at the

86
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:08,660
讲座开始时不对半导体器件进行检查
beginning of the lecture the
semiconductor devices is not examinable

87
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,180
兴奋剂是可以检查的，我们将在上一堂课的最后讨论
doping is examinable we are we discussed
this at the end of last lecture I'll

88
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,669
提醒您一些结果，那么如果我们掺杂半导体，密度
remind you of some of the results then
if we dope a semiconductor the density

89
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:23,750
导带中的电子数是一些常数，我不会写下来
of electrons in the conduction band is
some constants which I won't write down

90
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,720
乘以一个指数因子，甚至是负βII传导负μ 
times an exponential factor even the
minus beta II conduction minus mu

91
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,220
所以基本上这个指数的大部分告诉你
so basically the big part of this the
exponential factor tells you that you

92
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,840
必须激活电子从化学物质进入导带
have to activate an electron up into the
conduction band from the chemical

93
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,160
势，它以指数方式被激活到导带中，然后
potential it's exponentially activated
up into the conduction band okay and

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,450
然后前面有几个前置因素没那么有趣
then there's a couple pre factors out
front which aren't that interesting

95
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,180
同样，实际上应该清楚，当您提高化学势时
similarly and actually should be clear
that as you raise the chemical potential

96
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,770
朝向导带，导带中的电子密度
towards the conduction band the density
of electrons in the conduction band goes

97
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,080
如果我们想知道价带中空穴的密度， 
up similarly if we want to know about
the density of holes in the valence band

98
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:12,890
 P某些常数甚至会减去beta nu减去DV，所以类似
P that some constants also even minus
beta nu minus DV so similarly we have

99
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,870
孔被激活到价带，因为记住
the holes being activated down into the
valence band because remember to

100
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,490
需要能量将一个孔向下推到价带中
requires energy to push a hole down into
the valence band the holes want to

101
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,320
如果您将化学势向下移动，气泡会再次被激活
bubble up again it's activated if you
move the chemical potential down towards

102
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,400
价带，然后空穴的密度上升，质量定律
the valence band then the density of
holes goes up the law of mass action

103
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:43,310
群众行动告诉我们T的这两个事物n的乘积等于
mass action tells us that the product of
these two things n of T P of T equals

104
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,740
这两个常数中有两个常数，然后将此e传递给
and there's a couple of these these two
sets of constants then this e to the

105
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:54,260
负βe传导负价，这与化学反应无关
minus beta e conduction minus e valence
and this is independent of the chemical

106
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:59,960
势，所以应该从这些方程中拿走什么呢？ 
potential so what one should take away
from this these equations for which have

107
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,470
与电子密度和空穴的导带密度有关
to do with density of electrons and the
conduction band density of holes in the

108
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:10,760
价带是如果我们用
valence band
is that if we dope if dope heavily with

109
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:20,080
换句话说，如果有很多供体，则化学势会上升到
n in other words and a lot of donors
then chemical potential goes up up to

110
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,450
导带能量朝着导带能量上升
the conduction band energy goes up
towards the conduction band energy

111
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,810
因为我们必须增加电子数量同时将产品保留在这里
because we have to raise the number of
electrons while keeping the product here

112
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,919
固定，唯一发生的方法是提高化学势
fixed and the only way that happens is
by raising the chemical potential

113
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:40,130
同样地，如果我们大量地使用毒品
similarly if we dope heavily if dope
heavily

114
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:52,740
 P受体在价带上增加空穴，然后mu下降到
with P acceptors adding holes to the
valence band then mu goes down to the

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,080
价带能量好很多，这就是可以检验的一切
valence band energy okay is that much
good that's everything that's examinable

116
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,410
关于设备物理的是这两个板块，所以现在我们可以做
about a device physics is these two two
boards right here so now what we can do

117
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,920
我们可以考虑如果在半导体中加入一些掺杂剂会发生什么
is we can think about what happens if we
put some dopants in our semiconductor

118
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
这将我们带到第一个有趣的设备PN 
and this brings us to our first
interesting device which is the PN

119
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,380
结PN结被意外发现或本质上被发现
Junction PN Junction which was
surprisingly discovered or essentially

120
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,630
费迪南德·布劳恩·弗农·布朗（Ferdinand Braun Vernon Brown）在1874年发现的行星实际上不知道是什么
discovered in 1874 by Ferdinand Braun
Vernon Brown actually had no idea what

121
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,560
是他被发现的，但他是一个足够聪明的物理学家，以至于意识到
it was he discovered but he was a clever
enough a physicist to realize that what

122
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,640
他发现真的很有趣，实际上这变得非常重要
he discovered was really interesting in
fact it became an extremely important

123
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,360
事情是一个小的电子小部件，使开发
thing it was a little electronic widget
that enabled the development of the

124
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,709
没有勃拉姆斯发现这个设备的收音机，我们将无法
radio without Brahms discovering of this
device we wouldn't have been able to

125
00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:43,800
建立收音机，当然，收音机是真正的发明之一
build a radio and of course the radio is
one of the inventions that really

126
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,730
 PN结在许多方面改变了通信并改变了世界
changed communications and change the
world in many ways so PN Junction

127
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,800
改变了世界回到1800年代或1900年代初，但实际上
changed the world back in the 1800's or
beginning of 1900s but actually it

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,580
真的不明白为什么PN结表现出它的行为方式
wasn't really understood why the PN
Junction behaved the way it did in for

129
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,970
布朗发现后大约70年，让我们看看是否可以
about seventy years after Browns
discovery so let's see if we can

130
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,089
了解布朗不明白的是什么，所以首先
understand what it was that Brown didn't
understand so first of all what is the

131
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:08,760
结构，所以您从一大块半导体开始，而您只需掺杂一个
structure so you start with a big piece
of semiconductor and you just P dope one

132
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:15,270
当你梵天时，你要涂另一面，然后再涂另一面
side of it and you n dope the other side
and dope the other side now when Brahma

133
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,360
实际上建造了这个，他拿了两块材料，只是把它们粘住了
actually built this he took two pieces
of materials and just stuck them

134
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,079
在现代时代，您会一起取一个大晶体，然后添加一些掺杂剂
together in the modern era you take one
big crystal and you add some dopants

135
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,290
在这里，您可以在此处添加一些掺杂剂，而不是
over here and you add some dopants over
here much more controlled than what

136
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,589
布朗做到了，但总体上是相同的想法，所以让我们来画一下
brown did but generally the same idea
and so let's draw a picture of where the

137
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,940
导带和价带是，所以导带能量可能是
conduction band and the valence band are
so the conduction band energy might be

138
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,740
在这里价带能量可能在这里这里价带在这里和这里
up here the valence band energy might be
down here a valence down here and here's

139
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,250
我们中间的师现在在这边
our division in the middle now over on
this side

140
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,810
我们是n掺杂的，这意味着我们在传导中有一堆电子
we're n-doped so that means we have a
bunch of electrons up in the conduction

141
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:56,170
带在这里，化学势是方法
band
here and the chemical potential is way

142
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:01,209
在这里，在导电带附近，因为我们已经用
up here mu up here near the conduction
band because we've doped it with the

143
00:11:01,209 --> 00:11:04,029
电子，所以化学势上升到导带能量
electron so the chemical potential went
up towards the conduction band energy

144
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:14,370
现在好了，在这里，价带上有一堆孔， 
good now over down here we have a bunch
of holes in the valence band and the

145
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:20,589
到目前为止，化学势已被拉低至价带能附近
chemical potential has been pulled down
to near the valence band energy so far

146
00:11:20,589 --> 00:11:23,560
很好，现在它的绘制方式
so good
alright now the way it's drawn this

147
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,949
看起来您左侧有负电荷，而在左侧有正电荷
looks like you have negative charges on
the left and positive charges on the

148
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:31,360
对，这实际上是不正确的，因为我们省略了原子核上的电荷
right that's not actually true because
we've left out the charges on the nuclei

149
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,320
所以原子核有电荷我们的原子核也有补偿
so the nuclei have charges also nuclei
nukes we and they have compensating

150
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,820
像这样的收费，而comping chain在这里收费，因为您还记得
charges like this and comping chain
charges over here because you remember

151
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,000
当您添加例如在硅中添加磷时，您会添加额外的
when you add a for example when you add
a phosphorous to silicon you add a extra

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,959
核电荷，您还添加了额外的电子，整个事物都是中性的
nuclear charge you also add an extra
electron the whole thing is neutral the

153
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,199
电子进入导带但你留在正核中
electron goes off into the conduction
band but you left in a positive nuclear

154
00:11:56,199 --> 00:12:01,120
后面也要充电，所以这里的一切都是电中性的，没有电
charge behind as well so everything here
is electrically neutral no electric

155
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,230
场电子负电荷由核正补偿。 
fields electron negative charge is
compensated by the nuclear positive

156
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,899
电荷，整个正电荷由受体补偿
charge and the whole positive charge is
compensated by the by the acceptor

157
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:16,990
到目前为止这里的负电荷很好，现在这里我们有电子在这里
negative charge here so far so good okay
now here we have electrons up here in

158
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,980
导带我们在价带上有孔，实际上
the conduction band and we have holes
here in the valence band and in fact

159
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,070
这个电子，如果他跌落到价带消灭它的空穴，他
this electron if he falls down to the
valence band annihilating its hole he

160
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:31,540
可以释放能量，例如可以发出光子并降低能量，那么
can let off energy he can emit a photon
for example and lower the energy so what

161
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:37,149
发生的是将电子重置这里的眼睛有点种族的转变
happens is reset the electron here an
eye a little bit of a race to transform

162
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:41,740
消灭整个电子消灭整个电子
annihilates the whole electron
annihilates the whole and you end up

163
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,420
对我来说是一个区域，在这里歼灭一次，然后歼灭
with a region to me annihilate one more
here annihilate one more and we end up

164
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,360
从这里到这里中间是这个区域，称为耗尽
with this region in the middle from here
to here which is known as the depletion

165
00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:01,660
没有电子也没有电子的区域耗尽区
region depletion region
where there are no electrons and no

166
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:04,089
漏洞，没有移动电荷载体了
holes there's no mobile charge carriers
anymore

167
00:13:04,089 --> 00:13:09,819
你只剩下静核电荷，没事了，所以你
you only have the static nuclear charges
left okay nothing moving around so you

168
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:14,529
可能认为这种this灭会继续下去，因为电子上升了
might think that this annihilation would
keep going because the electrons are up

169
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:18,550
在高能量时，空穴在低能量时下降，所以我们可以保持
at high energy and the holes are down at
low energy so we can just keep

170
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,879
消灭带有空穴的电子会继续发射光子，并且越来越低， 
annihilating electrons with holes keep
emitting photons and lower and lower and

171
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:26,439
降低能量，但事实并非如此，它不会一直持续下去， 
lower the energy but that's not true in
fact it doesn't keep going and the

172
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:30,160
之所以不能持续下去，是因为我们在这之后留下了净费用
reason it doesn't keep going is because
we're leaving a net charge behind this

173
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,240
该区域现在被充电，这是由于掺杂剂导致的净正电荷
region now is charged this is net
positive charge because of the dopants

174
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,160
这是净负电荷-电荷，所以当我们开始清醒时，我们离开
and this is net negative charge - charge
so as we start an eye elating we leave

175
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,389
实际上这里是带电区域，这里是带电区域，这意味着我们
actually a charged region here and a
charged region here and that means we

176
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,629
有一个电场，我想
have an electric field
I guess the electric field points from

177
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:52,600
 -对正数和-存入正数负数让我们看看
the - to the positive and - deposit
positive negative which way let's see

178
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,370
那些正电荷的方向
the direction of a positive charge those

179
00:13:57,389 --> 00:14:02,019
指向这种方式，电场从正网
points this way yeah
electric field goes from positive net

180
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:08,230
测试费用转为负数是的，没错，所以有一个
test charge goes towards the negative
yes okay got it right so so there's an

181
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,910
我们在这里建立的电场，随着我们的歼灭更多
electric field here that we're building
up and as we annihilate more more

182
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,720
电荷在这里最终会导致越来越多的电场，这意味着如果我们
charges here we end up with more and
more electric field and that means if we

183
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,250
要在这里再吸收一个电子，然后再消灭一个空穴，我们首先
want to take one more electron here and
annihilate one more hole here we first

184
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:26,680
我们必须要爬上一个潜在的山丘才能得到一个静电的山丘
must we must climb up a potential hill
an electrostatic potential hill to get

185
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,569
越过这个电场到达此处的某个孔
past this electric field to reach the
hole here at some point this

186
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:35,649
静电势山变得太大，我们无法克服它，我们
electrostatic potential hill becomes too
big and we can't get over it and we

187
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:42,879
不能再有an灭了，所以耗尽宽度耗尽了
can't have any more annihilation so the
depletion width deplete the depletion

188
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:53,110
宽度宽度通过设置间隙能量e间隙能量的数量来设置
width metion width is set by setting the
gap energy e gap the amount of energy

189
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:57,699
你会通过消除更多的能量和更多的电子而获得收益
you would you would gain by annihilating
one more energy with one more electron

190
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:03,610
 Munroe孔的能量等于e乘以Delta Phi的能量
with Munroe hole is has to equal to e
times Delta Phi the amount of energy you

191
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,889
必须放入其中以使电子越过静电山
have to put into it to get the electron
over the electrostatic hill that you're

192
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,360
为使电子越过
fighting against to move the electron
past the

193
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,660
这个充电区域是清楚的，大概有人，是，好，至少有人
this charge region is that clear roughly
someone yes okay good at least someone

194
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:27,120
说是的，这里的这种潜力只是来自
said yes so and this this potential here
is just the integral of e dot DL from

195
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:34,180
整个系统都很好，所以通常我们不相信
well across the system alright so so the
generally we we don't believe that this

196
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,000
耗尽宽度将无限大，它将停止在
depletion width is going to be
infinitely big it's going to stop at

197
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,380
某些区域，但这不是绘制发生情况的好方法，因为这看起来
some region but this is not a good way
to draw what goes on because this looks

198
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,060
有点看起来有点奇怪，看起来看起来不正确，我的意思是看起来
a little it looks a little strange it
looks it looks incorrect I mean it looks

199
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,270
就像这里的电子具有较高的能量，而空穴具有较低的能量
like the electron here is at higher
energy and the hole is at lower energy

200
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,020
所以看起来电子仍然应该消灭空穴
so it kind of looks like the electron
should still want to annihilate the hole

201
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,140
但是我们知道有一个电场使它变得困难，所以我们
but we know that there's an electric
field that's making it difficult so we

202
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,680
我们想要做的是我们想要以某种方式重绘这张图片
what we want to do is we want to redraw
this picture in a way that will make it

203
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,180
很明显，电子不想来消灭另外一个空穴，所以
obvious that the electron doesn't want
to come and annihilate one more hole so

204
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:10,620
我们要做的是根据所谓的电化学势绘制事物
what we do is we draw things in terms of
the so-called electrochemical potential

205
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:19,030
电化学势是有规律的组合
electrochemical potential potential
which is the combination of the regular

206
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,220
化学势和静电势都可以，所以我们要作图
chemical potential and the electrostatic
potential okay so we're going to plot

207
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:29,470
相反，它将结合在一起，所以带结构
that instead which is going to combine
together the so the band structure

208
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,300
以及我们留下的空间电荷的库仑效应
diagram as well as the Coulomb effects
of the space charge that we left behind

209
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:40,480
所以在这边画一幅我们以前画过的画
so over on this side
draw the same picture we had before so

210
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,070
我们在这里有一个导电带电化学势
we have a the conduction band of energy
up here the electrochemical potential

211
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:50,110
我们将其放在此处，这是一个mu减去E Phi，我们有价带
we'll put here so this is a mu minus E
Phi over here we have the valence band

212
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,740
这边的能量D价现在在另一边，我们要排队
energy over here D valence now over here
on the other side we are going to line

213
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:01,390
电化学势完全相同，但是这里的价带
up the electrochemical potential exactly
the same but here the valence band

214
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:06,459
能量将是化合价，导带能量将在此处
energy will be here a valence and the
conduction band energy will be up here

215
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:13,060
传导和这些被连接在一起，就像这样，那是
the conduction and these get connected
together like this okay that's those are

216
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:17,949
应该是平行线不是很平行应该证明是的，让我
supposed to be parallel lines not very
parallel should prove it yeah let me

217
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:22,560
改善它需要更多一点，所以它们看起来非常隐约
improve it needs this up a little bit
more so they look very vaguely parallel

218
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:30,160
所以这些应该是我会教其他好的东西，所以我已经
so these are supposed to be
I'll teach other okay good so all I've

219
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,490
完成就是我把那张照片拍到那里，我把它扭曲了
done is I've taking that picture up
there and I've twisted it I've sort of

220
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,410
弯曲它以解决额外的静电势
bent it so as to account for the
additional electrostatic potential so

221
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,940
现在，在左侧和右侧，电化学势与
now that on the left and the right the
electrochemical potential lines up with

222
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:46,810
那里的电化学势，告诉我们的是那里
the electrochemical potential over here
and what that tells us is it that there

223
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:51,820
如果将电子从该侧移到该侧，则没有净驱动力
is no net driving force for moving an
electron from this side to this side if

224
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,870
化学势有变化，但化学势也有变化
there's a change in the chemical
potential but there's equal change in

225
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,410
补偿它的静电势，所以左侧和
the electrostatic potential that
compensates it so the left-hand side and

226
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,350
就电子而言，右侧完全对齐
the right-hand side are completely lined
up as far as the electron is concerned

227
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:04,840
它不想向左移动电子不想向左移动
it doesn't want to move to the left the
electron doesn't want to go to left

228
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,290
不想走到右边，它只是想说保持原状，所以这是
don't want to go to the right either it
just wants to say stay put so this is

229
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,790
平衡的情况是很清楚如何画出来的
the equilibrium situation is that sort
of clear how this has been drawn okay

230
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:17,950
好吧，那是一张可怕的照片，不是吗，但是这个设备在这里
all right that's a terrible picture
isn't it okay but this this device here

231
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,420
这基本上是PN结的物理原理，即使它像
this is basically the physics of the PN
Junction and even as it stands just like

232
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,690
没有做任何进一步的事情，这是一个有趣的设备，因为它
that without doing anything further it's
an interesting device because it's

233
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:32,670
基本上是太阳能电池太阳能电池或光电电池光电电池
basically a solar cell a solar or
photoelectric cell photoelectric cell

234
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:44,110
电池，其想法是将光子放入光子中
cell and the idea of this is that you
put in photons put in photons get out

235
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:54,250
当前得到电流，这种把光子放进去的想法
current get current and this idea of
putting in photons and getting our

236
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,240
当前是一个您知道的200亿美元的行业，如果人们
current is a you know twenty billion
dollar industry right now if people

237
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,190
试图建立光电池来替代我们的化石燃料， 
trying to build photo cells that are
going to replace our fossil fuels and

238
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:06,220
可能拯救我们的世界免受全球变暖和其他一切的影响，所以我
potentially save our world from global
warming and everything else so I

239
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,460
鼓励大家进入半导体行业并尝试图
encourage all of you to go into the
semiconductor industry and try to figure

240
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,700
展示了我们将如何使太阳能电池更高效，以便我们能够获得所有
out how we're going to make solar cells
more efficient so that we can get all of

241
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,120
我们的力量来自这些东西，而不是燃烧煤炭，石油和其他东西
our power from these things instead of
from burning coal and oil and things

242
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,440
无论如何，让我们尝试弄清楚为什么这是该设备
like that at any rate let's try to
figure out why it is that this device

243
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:25,180
具有此属性，如果您将其置于灯光中，将会获得最新电流，因此，如果您
has this property that if you put in
light you'll get out current so if you

244
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:30,850
将光放入此图片中，您可以激发电子
put in light into this into this picture
you can excite an electron from the

245
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:35,320
价带至导带，所以您在后面留下一个洞
valence band up to the conduction band
so you leave a hole behind and you

246
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,770
从价态激发电子直至导带
excite an electron up to the conduction
band from the valence

247
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,310
现在在这个耗尽区，有一个电场， 
and now in this depletion region there's
an electric field there's a strong

248
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:45,970
在此耗尽区中的电场，您可以在这张图片中通过
electric field in this depletion region
you can see it in this picture by the

249
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,900
这些带的曲率以及电子要发生什么
curvature of these bands and what
happens is the electron wants to it's

250
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,080
被电场朝这个方向推动，因为它想下降到
pushed by the electric field in this
direction because it wants to go down to

251
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:57,340
较低的能量，孔朝这个方向被推动，希望上升到更高
lower energy and the hole is pushed in
this direction wants to go up to higher

252
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:02,800
能量，因为空穴总是试图在能带结构中上升
energy because holes always try to go up
in the in the band structure and either

253
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:07,240
这样，这总是当前的趋势，它要么是积极的，要么是积极的
way this is always current
going to the right it's either positive

254
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,260
当前正电荷向右移动，这就是正向移动或
current positive charge going to the
right this is plus going to the right or

255
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:15,520
负电荷向左移动，这两个电流在同一电流中
negative charge going to the left and
both of those are current in the same

256
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,240
方向，因此只需在此处放置一个光子
direction so just by putting in a photon
here photon which creates this

257
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,700
激发你设法产生电流，所以这是你所知道的物理
excitation you manage to create current
so this is the you know the the physics

258
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,930
这将使我们免于全球变暖的影响之一，所以请您知道
is going to save us from global warming
one of these days so please you know go

259
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:38,170
进入这个世界，弄清楚如何更好地打造那些你知道他们是
off into the world and figure out how to
build those better you know they're

260
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,770
仍然不如燃烧化石燃料便宜，所以人们不愿意
still not quite as cheap as burning
fossil fuels so people aren't willing to

261
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:48,610
使用它们，但也许有一天我们会好起来的，这不是费迪南德·布朗
use them yet but maybe someday we will
okay this is not what Ferdinand Brown

262
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:53,440
在1874年发现了他发现的东西就是同一台设备
discovered in 1874 what he discovered
was something very was the same device

263
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,080
但是他发现了这些东西产生的另一种影响
but but he discovered another effect
that these things have which is maybe

264
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:07,240
同样有趣的是整改的效果，这意味着
equally interesting which is the effect
of rectification which means that

265
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:16,770
电流以一种方式流向Lowe一种方式，但另一种则不
current flows one way Lowe's one way one
way but not the other

266
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,670
如果您的电路很好，那么您也许可以弄清楚为什么
and if you're good with your circuits
you might be able to figure out why it

267
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:31,260
是具有此属性的东西，它可以纠正您
is that having something that with this
property which rectifies enables you to

268
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,920
建立一个收音机，这是他很快意识到的，如果您有东西
build a radio which is what he realized
very quickly that if you have something

269
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,860
纠正允许电流以一种方式流动，但不允许另一种方式流动
that rectifies allowing current to flow
one way but not the other

270
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,290
你可以用它来建立一个收音机，为什么呢？为什么呢？ 
you can build a radio with it so why is
why is this why does it have that

271
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:49,080
物理，好吧，让我们拿起这个装置，让我们想象一下，让我画
physics oh okay let's take this device
and let's imagine well let me draw the

272
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,830
再次显示相同的图片，除了我现在要做的是要输入电压
same picture again except what I'm going
to do now is I'm going to put a voltage

273
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,700
跨过这张图片以尝试使电流流动，所以让我们这样做
across this picture to try to get
current to flow so let's do that

274
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:03,240
绘制所有完全相同的图片您看到的是电化学势
draw all exactly the same picture you
see here's the electrochemical potential

275
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,070
 mu减去e Phi在左边，然后在下面是价带能量
mu minus e Phi on the left and then down
here is the valence band energy availing

276
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,360
在这里，而不是准确地排列电化学势
over here instead of lining up the
electrochemical potentials exactly on

277
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,960
左右，我将把化学势转移到
the left and the right I'm going to
shift the chemical potential down to the

278
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,530
此处的电化学势，如果这是精确排列的
electrochemical potential down here so
this is if it was lined up exactly it

279
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,820
在这里排列完全相同，现在我将其向下移动
would be exactly the same lined up here
and now I'm going to shift it downwards

280
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,540
通过一些能量在这里传达出来，这就是
by evey here by some energy so this is
the electrochemical potential on the

281
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:37,170
现在就这样，因为我要在整个事情上施加电压
right so now because I'm putting a
voltage across the whole thing

282
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:45,210
所以我们必须在这里加上价带能量
so then we have to put in the valence
band energy I guess mu minus D Phi here

283
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,070
在这里，价带能量在这里是价和导带
is here and the valence band energy is
here a valence and the conduction band

284
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,260
能量将在此处感应，然后在耗尽区域中您有电
energy will be up here duction then in
the depletion region you have electric

285
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,550
像这样将这些连接在一起的字段，这样很清楚我画了什么
field which connects these together like
that okay so is it clear what I've drawn

286
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:04,260
在这里，我拍摄的照片完全相同，只是在
here I've taken exactly the same picture
I've just applied a voltage across the

287
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:13,590
两个将这种化学势转移到这里好吧，所以现在
two to shift this chemical potential
down to here good alright so um now now

288
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,270
我已经施加了这个电压有多少电流流过
that I've applied this this voltage how
much current flows well there's several

289
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,580
获得电流的方法一种获得电流的方法我们称此过程为
ways you can get current one way to get
current let's call this process one is

290
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:28,050
价带中的电子可以被激发到导带
that electron in the valence band could
get excited up to the conduction band

291
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,270
然后最终找到下坡路
and then eventually find its way down
the hill

292
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:35,830
好吧，让我们称过程1和过程2有点相反
okay so let's call that process one
and process 2 is sort of the reverse of

293
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,240
导带上的空穴会被激发下来
that which is the hole up in the
conduction band could get excited down

294
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,230
进入价带，因为记住需要正能量来推动一个洞
into the valence band because remember
requires positive energy to push a hole

295
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:49,870
下降到价带，然后找到它的上山路，所以过程1＆2 1＆ 
down into the valence band and then find
its way up the hill so process 1 & 2 1 &

296
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,950
 2这要么是电子向左移动，要么是空穴向右移动， 
2 this either an electron going to the
left or a hole going to the right and

297
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:04,960
无论哪种方式，比率都是e到负beta e差距，因为限制步骤是
either way it's rate is e to the minus
beta e gap because the limiting step is

298
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,470
使电子上升到导带或使空穴下降
to get the electron up into the
conduction band or get the hole down

299
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,179
进入价带，这会消耗您的能隙能量，所以它被激活了，所以
into the valence band and that costs you
the gap energy so it's activated okay so

300
00:24:13,179 --> 00:24:16,240
这是可能会导致电流发生的一件事，而另一件事是
that's one thing that can happen that
can cause current but another thing that

301
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,120
如果您有一些电子，可能会导致电流
can happen that can cause current did
you have some number of electrons up

302
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,070
在导带中，他们可以爬上山，让我们
here in the conduction band already and
they could just climb up the hill let's

303
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,150
叫3或在价带上有一些孔，他们可以
call that 3 or we have some holes here
in the valence band and they can just

304
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:37,659
爬下山，我们称它为4，所以3＆4 3＆4我们有电子进入
climb down the hill let's call it 4 so 3
& 4 3 & 4 we have electrons going to the

305
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:44,200
右边或左边的孔，它们以e到负的比率发生
right or holes going to the left and
they happen at a rate of e to the minus

306
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:53,909
 e gap-Evi为什么从这里到这里的这座山的高度这么好
e gap - Evi why is that well the height
of this hill from here to here is e gap

307
00:24:53,909 --> 00:25:01,480
 -Evi如果我们未应用此Evie，则间隙能量将完全相同
- Evi if we had not applied this evie it
would be exactly the same gap energy

308
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,740
我们需要爬上山，但是现在我们减少了那座山， 
that we would need to climb up the hill
but now we've reduced that hill we

309
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:12,010
通过在系统上施加电压来减小山丘的大小
reduced the size of the hill by evey by
applying the voltage across the system

310
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:20,140
因此，当前的总JJ等于，这将是
so the total current total J J equals
well it's going to be a combination of

311
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:28,030
这两个东西，他们称其为1-e减去beta e差距减去3 4 
these two things they call it a 1 - e to
the minus beta e gap minus a 3 4 those

312
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:35,440
只是负e差距的系数e-CD 
are just coefficients e to the minus
beta e gap - CD which

313
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,160
好的，那么我们需要知道这些系数是多少，但实际上是
okay then we need to know what these
coefficients are but actually the sort

314
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,730
诀窍在于，电压为零时的电流应为零
of a trick for that that the current
when they're zero voltage should be zero

315
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,560
如果您不对系统施加任何电压，则不应获得任何电流，因此
if you don't apply any voltage to the
system you shouldn't get any current so

316
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,360
这意味着1 2和3 4应该相等，所以J与e成正比
that means a 1 2 and a 3 4 should be
equal so J is proportional to e to the

317
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:01,660
减去beta egapp，我认为乘以KBT的时间是EV 
minus beta egapp I factored that out
times e to the e v over KBT

318
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:09,970
那是beta e V减去1 ok，所以这就是所谓的二极管方程二极管
that's beta e V minus 1 ok so this is
what's known as the diode equation diode

319
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:16,240
等式PN结或整流器有时也称为二极管
equation the PN Junction or the
rectifier is sometimes known as a diode

320
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:28,990
我们可以在此处绘制其行为，以便在该轴上有当前电压
and we can plot its behavior here so we
have current voltage on this axis and

321
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:36,340
该轴上的电流，它是电压的指数，所以这是
current on this axis and it's
exponential in in the voltage so this is

322
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:41,500
这是零电流，这是负电流，所以也许我应该
this is zero current here and this is
negative current here so maybe I should

323
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:46,740
画的像是零在这里，负在这里，所以正
have drawn it like this zero is here and
negative is here so it with positive

324
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:52,510
电压呈指数上升，而负电压呈恒定
voltage it goes up exponentially whereas
negative voltage it goes to a constant

325
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,210
这是一个非常小的常数，因此通常用图形表示
which is extremely small constant so
this is frequently drawn figuratively as

326
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:04,800
像这样笔直向上，像这样笔直平坦
being straight up like this and straight
flat like this which you know the

327
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,950
大概说它允许电流沿一个方向流动，并且不允许
approximately say it allows current to
flow in one direction and allows no

328
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,930
我们经常在另一个方向上流动电流
current to flow in the other direction
frequently we draw in a circuit diagram

329
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:20,590
我们画了一个像这样的二极管，这意味着电流仅流入一个
we draw a diode like this diode which
means current flows only in one

330
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,840
方向好吧，这是一种非常整洁的设备，可以在您进入电路时
direction okay it's pretty neat device
to put into your circuits when you're

331
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,130
设计电路，这就是费尔南德·布朗通过实验发现的
designing circuits so this was what
Fernand Brown discovered experimentally

332
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,180
或多或少，直到1940年代人们才真正了解
more or less and it wasn't understood
until 1940s when people really developed

333
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,640
对半导体物理学有很好的了解，那时他们
a good understanding of semiconductor
physics and by that time when they

334
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,340
终于了解了半导体物理学，他们意识到自己可以做得更多
finally understood semiconductor physics
they realize they could do a lot more

335
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,600
而不是仅仅制造二极管，这使他们能够启动
with it than just building diodes and
this enabled them to start

336
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,230
致力于改变世界的下一个重大发明
working on the next big invention that
changed the world which is the

337
00:27:53,230 --> 00:28:00,520
晶体管由John Bardeen Walter的Bell Labs团队于1947年发明
transistor invented in 1947 by the Bell
Labs team of John Bardeen Walter

338
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,970
 Brattain和William Shockley Bardeen绝对是每个人都应该使用的名字
Brattain and William Shockley Bardeen is
definitely a name that everyone should

339
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,809
知道是因为他知道晶体管的两个诺贝尔奖，一个因为晶体管
know because he one knew two Nobel
Prizes one for the transistor one for

340
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,750
超导理论是非常光明的，但几乎是未知的人
the theory of superconductivity are very
bright but pretty much unknown person

341
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:19,960
而该器件的晶体管是最基本的最小片
and this device the transistor is the
elementary the the smallest piece the

342
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:25,299
基本部件现在已经成为每台计算机制造的基础
elementary piece the building block of
every computer ever made now it's in

343
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:30,250
您的平均手机，笔记本电脑或iPad有数十亿个
your average cell phone or laptop or
iPad there are billions of these

344
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,400
数以十亿计的晶体管在那里
transistors sitting literally billions
of them in there

345
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,450
基本开关或基本放大器可以使所有功能
it's the elementary switch or elementary
amplifier that enables everything to

346
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,950
工作，所以晶体管有许多不同的品种，我们要去的品种
work so transistors come in many
different varieties the one we're going

347
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:48,760
要讨论的实际上是MOSFET MOSFET，它代表金属
to discuss is actually known as the
MOSFET MOSFET which stands for metal

348
00:28:48,760 --> 00:29:05,169
氧化物氧化物半导体场效应晶体管电阻，我来解释
oxide oxide semiconductor field effect
transistor resistor and I'll explain

349
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,070
这是什么意思，尽管我们应该评论一下
what that means as we as we get to it
although I should comment that the

350
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,750
他们在1947年建造的原始晶体管不是这种设计，而是
original transistor that they built in
1947 was not of this design they were

351
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:17,169
意识到他们可以构建此设计，但由于各种原因，他们决定
aware that they could build this design
but for various reasons they decided

352
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:20,049
那不是他们要首先尝试建造的那个。 
that was not the one they were going to
try to build first this is the type of

353
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,650
现在最常在电路中使用的晶体管，这就是为什么要解释
transistor that's used most frequently
in circuits now so that's why explaining

354
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:28,299
那个也更容易理解它使谈论方式变得更好
that one it's also easier to understand
it makes it nicer to talk about the way

355
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:33,909
它的工作原理是相当简单的设备，需要大量的半导体， 
it works is fairly simple device you
take a big piece of semiconductor and

356
00:29:33,909 --> 00:29:38,230
你P掺杂它，它有这样的表面，你可以向后做
you P dope it and it has a surface like
this you could do it backwards you could

357
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:42,130
内在，但如果您想，但让我们开始想象它是P掺杂的，那么我们采取
endo but if you wanted to but let's
start imagine it's P doped then we take

358
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,860
两个小区域，最后我们把它们扩大到了这个区域
two small regions and we end up them
make it a little bigger this region here

359
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,470
 n在这里掺杂这个区域，然后我们在这里掺杂这个区域，这是
n doped this region here and then we'll
M dope this region here this and this is

360
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:59,260
所有P掺杂都可以，所以我们现在拥有的表面是N掺杂n掺杂
all P doped okay so what we have now is
we have a surface with an N dope n dope

361
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,130
还有大量的P掺杂，我们将在此处放置联系人
and a big bulk with P doped we'll put
contacts here on

362
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,600
电线进入我们称为源极-源极线，这被称为漏极
wires coming in this we call a source
source wire and this is called the drain

363
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:13,540
线漏，然后我们尝试现在将电流从源极流到漏极
wire drain and then we try to run
current from the source to the drain now

364
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,710
如果您在这里查看此结构，您将意识到它不是当前的
if you look at this structure here
you'll realize that it's current is not

365
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,330
从源头流到漏极
going to flow from the source to the
drain

366
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,070
您会在nmp之间的界面处有一个耗尽区，有一个NP 
you'll have a depletion region at the
interface between nmp there's an NP

367
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:30,520
那里的结和PN结在这里，其中一个PN结想要
Junction there and PN Junction here and
one of the PN junctions wants the

368
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,150
当前只以一种方式流动，而另一种只希望其流动
current to only flow one way and the
other one wants it to flow only the

369
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:37,900
另一种方式，你可以比喻地想像一下，因为你知道两个
other way you can kind of think of it
figuratively as being you know two

370
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,670
背对背二极管指向相反的方向，因此其中一个仅允许
back-to-back diodes pointing in opposite
directions so one of them only allows

371
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,280
流到左边的电流只有另一个是流过的电流
the current to flow to the left the
other one only was the current to flow

372
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,130
在右边，所以在他们两个之间您无法通过
to the right so between the two of them
you can't get any kind of through it at

373
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,480
一切都好，所以这看起来很无聊，但是现在我们添加了
all okay so this looks like a boring
device but now we add the last part of

374
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,900
这样的设备，我们在上面放了一块大金属
the device we put a big piece of metal
on top like this

375
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:05,080
被称为金属金属门的门，然后我们将其连接到
which is known as the gate that metal
metal gate and then we attach it to the

376
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:10,570
通过一点点电池来供电，所以电压加上类似的电池
source via a little bit of battery here
so voltage plus battery like that

377
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,290
附在金属栅极上，然后我们在两者之间放置一个绝缘体
attached to the metal gate and then we
put an insulator in between here which

378
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,870
通常是氧化物层，这就是设备金属的名称
is usually an oxide layer and this is
what gives the name of the device metal

379
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,940
氧化物半导体，因此门是金属，氧化物在中间， 
oxide semiconductor so the gate is metal
the oxide is in the middle and the

380
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,810
底部的半导体氧化物的目的只是为了制造一个小的
semiconductors on the bottom the purpose
of the oxide is just to make a small

381
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:33,130
绝缘层，这样金属就不会接触半导体了
insulating layer so the metal doesn't
touch the semiconductor you can make it

382
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,310
任何您想要的东西通常都是由氧化物制成，非常好
of anything you want it's just typically
made of oxides which are very nice

383
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:39,640
绝缘子，它们很容易制造，您可以用任何绝缘子制成
insulators and they're easy to build you
could make it of any insulator you

384
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,580
想放在那里，你可以使它成为Dimond，你可以使它成为你知道的
wanted to put there you could make it of
Dimond you can make it of you know it

385
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,310
如果您愿意的话，可能只是真空，但关键是您必须拥有金属
could be just vacuum if you wanted but
the point is you have to have the metal

386
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,150
不接触半导体，因此通常称为金属氧化物半导体
not touching the semiconductor so it's
usually called metal oxide semiconductor

387
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,940
实际上，闸门不必一定是金属，也不必一定是金属
in fact the gate doesn't have to be
metal either it just has to be

388
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,780
因此，只要在任何地方进行，它就可以随心所欲
conducting so it can be whatever you
want as long as it's conducting at any

389
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,120
之所以称其为金属氧化物半导体，是因为它几乎总是
rate it's called metal oxide
semiconductor because it's almost always

390
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,720
由金属氧化物和半导体制成的，这的目的是什么
made of metal oxide and semiconductor
all right so what's the purpose of this

391
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,020
金属化这个金属门，您可以对其充电，因此它上面有正电荷
metal this metal gate you charge it up
so it has plus charges on it and this

392
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,980
加上电荷就像一个电容器，它们将吸引负数
plus charges act like a capacitor and
they're going to attract negative

393
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,270
在这里的半导体上充电现在这个区域是一些
charges on the semiconductor here now
this region is some

394
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,440
因此，如果您基本上只是在金属和
so if you basically just charging up a
capacitor plate between the metal and

395
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,540
半导体这个区域，它位于过去用于半导体的顶部
the semiconductor this region here on
the top of the semiconductor it used to

396
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,780
被p掺杂时您会在那里刺孔，但现在我们吸引了很多
be p-doped you stab holes there
but now we've attracted a lot of

397
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,820
电子进入该区域，因此不再是P掺杂，而是主要是n掺杂
electrons into that region so instead of
being P doped it's now majorly n dope

398
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,960
因为我们知道你只是在那儿吸引了电子，所以现在是n 
because we've you know we just attracted
electrons there so now it's n so instead

399
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,740
像我最初拥有的那张照片现在看起来
of having something that looks like that
picture I had originally it now looks

400
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,950
更像是从这里到这里的整个区域
more like this this whole region here
all the way from here to here is

401
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:52,410
负的是n掺杂的n中有电子，并且耗尽区
negative is n is n doped has has
electrons in it and the depletion region

402
00:32:52,410 --> 00:33:00,309
有点像这样的大环境现在您可以在这里获得最新的
sort of makes a big sort of environment
like this now here you can get current

403
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:05,230
通过该电子通道直接从该末端区域到该末端区域
directly from this end region to this
end region by this electron channel so

404
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:08,950
您已经在该层中添加了电子，以便电子可以直接从
you've added electrons to this layer so
the electrons can travel directly from

405
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,300
源极到漏极而不必经过PN结
the source to the drain without having
to go through a PN Junction that's the

406
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:19,870
好吧，就是对那个好东西感到满意，所以
point okay is that good happy with that
alright good so the characteristics of

407
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:26,170
这样的设备看起来或多或少像这样，如果您绘制电流与
such a device look more or less like
this that if you plot the current versus

408
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,980
电压这是源极和漏极之间的电压这是
the voltage this is the voltage between
the source and the drain this is the

409
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,390
如果不施加栅极电压，则电流将从源极流到漏极
current that flows from the source to
the drain if you put no gate voltage on

410
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:39,220
门等于零，几乎没有电流流动，但是如果你放一点
the gate equals zero you get almost no
current flowing but if you put a little

411
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:44,920
栅极上的栅极电压位等于2伏特等于2伏特
bit of gate voltage on the gate equals
say two volts equals two volts you all

412
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,750
突然之间有很多商店都在消耗电流，所以这使您可以
of a sudden get a lot of stores drain
current so this enables you to take the

413
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:54,460
栅极上的小电压并控制很大的电流，所以这基本上是
small voltage on the gate and control a
very large current so this is basically

414
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,500
您知道为什么该设备如此有用以至于可以充当放大器的原因
you know the why this device is so
useful it acts as an amplifier it can

415
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:04,000
放大门上很小的信号，然后您就可以做一些有趣的事情
amplify a very small signal on the gate
and then you can do interesting things

416
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,230
有了它，因为现在它已经成为一大潮流，您可以使用
with it because now it's become a big
current that you can work with okay the

417
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,119
构成现代所有计算机的基本电路
elementary circuit that element that
builds all computers in the modern age

418
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,409
好的，我希望你们中的许多人会继续学习更多的半导体
all right well I hope many of you will
go on and study more semiconductor

419
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:23,020
设备物理过程比过去的35分钟还要多，但这就是我们所需要的时间
device physics more than these last 35
minutes but this is all we have time for

420
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:27,399
不幸的是，在此过程中，我们必须继续进行最后阶段
in this course unfortunately we have to
move on to the the final segment of our

421
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,070
当然，我们课程的最后一部分是
course the final segment of our course
is to

422
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:37,239
把所有这些东西抛在我们后面，我们继续研究磁性
leaving all this stuff behind us and we
move on to study magnetism magnetism so

423
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,399
深吸一口气，然后我们继续讲磁性，第一个问题是

424
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,000
可能想问的是，为什么我们要研究磁性？为什么呢？ 
probably wants to ask is is why are we
studying magnetism and why are you

425
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,800
从第一天开始，现在就学习磁性的整个过程
studying magnetism now the whole course
pretty much from day one all the way up

426
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,429
在中途讲课十八次，现在我们真的
to lecture eighteen halfway through
which is right now we've really been

427
00:34:54,429 --> 00:35:00,280
一种或另一种方式研究波浪和固体的振动波
studying waves and solids one way or the
other way their vibrational waves over

428
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:04,060
那里的电子波或X射线波我们实际上只是在研究波
there electron waves or the x-ray waves
we're really just been studying waves in

429
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,880
固体以一种或另一种方式存在，并且磁性有些不同
solids in one way or the other
and magnetism is a little bit different

430
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,020
当我们开始磁性时，我们并不是真正在研究波浪和固体，所以为什么
we're not really studying waves and
solids when we starting magnetism so why

431
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,260
是我们对磁性的研究很好吗，我们有很多原因想要
is it that we're studying magnetism well
there's a lot of reasons why we want to

432
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,100
研究磁性我们想研究磁性的第一个原因是
study magnetism the first reason why we
want to study magnetism is it certainly

433
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,840
自古以来就知道这种效果，因为您知道它们是记录
it's an effect that's been known about
since antiquity you know they're records

434
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,760
知道磁力的人们，在希腊1000 BC，在中国1000 BC， 
of people knowing about magnetism 1000
BC in Greece thousand BC in China they

435
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,810
知道如何制作指南针，它可能早于成千上万
knew how to build compasses and it
probably predates that by thousands of

436
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:35,110
多年以来，他们可能是穴居人，他们知道磁性被卡住了
years probably they were cavemen who
knew about magnetism you're stuck notes

437
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:42,130
无论如何冰箱上都非常严重，但尽管事实是
on the refrigerator so serious anyway
but but despite the fact that this

438
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,450
众所周知，您知道成千上万年前
effect was was known about you know
thousands and thousands years ago there

439
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,390
直到人们明白了，它才完全不了解它
was absolutely no understanding of it
whatsoever until people understood

440
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,620
量子力学，这实际上使这一点非常有趣
quantum mechanics and that's one thing
that makes this very interesting in fact

441
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:58,030
 Bohr和Van Leeuwen有一个定理，称为Bohr Van Leeuwen 
there's a theorem by Bohr and Van
Leeuwen known as the Bohr Van Leeuwen

442
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,160
定理Niels Bohr我想大家都知道，但是henryka Van Leeuwen是其中之一
theorem Niels Bohr I think everyone
knows but henryka Van Leeuwen was one of

443
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:11,830
他的学生Lewin定理和摩拉维亚Lewin定理的内容是
his students Lewin theorem and the
content of the moravian Lewin theorem is

444
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:22,060
没有量子和，基本上没有磁性，没有量子，但是没有
basically no magnetism without quantum
sum without quantum but nothing in

445
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,010
古典物理学可以在任何意义上给您带来磁性，所以
classical physics can ever give you
magnetism in any sense so that's kind of

446
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,090
一个有趣的陈述，它告诉我们您知道磁场是一种
an interesting statement so it tells us
that you know that magnetism is a really

447
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:36,340
去了解你的宏观后果的好地方
good place to go to understand you know
the macroscopic ramifications of

448
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:40,060
微观磁性，这就是您要研究它的原因之一
microscopic magnetism so that's one of
the reasons why you want to study it

449
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:42,970
我们要研究磁性的另一个原因是， 
another reason we want to study
magnetism is because it's a rather

450
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,489
我们一直在做的一切都失败了
spectacular
failure of everything we've been doing

451
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:51,069
到目前为止，磁性我们迄今为止一直在研究的带理论将始终
so far that magnetism the band theory
we've been studying so far would always

452
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:54,789
预测您具有与向下自旋电子相同数量的向上自旋电子
predict that you have the same number of
up spin electrons as down spin electrons

453
00:36:54,789 --> 00:36:58,509
而在磁场中，事实并非如此，因为您在其中有磁性物质
whereas in magnetism it's just not true
you have magnetic substances where you

454
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,390
具有不同数量的自旋电子和自旋电子
have a different number of spin up
electrons and spin down electrons it's

455
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:04,690
完全超出了乐队理论，而且完全没有预料到
completely outside of band theory and
it's completely not predicted so

456
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:08,619
磁性是一种理解我们已经存在的局限性的方法
magnetism is a way to understand with
the limitations of what we've already

457
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:14,319
一直在做的最后原因可能不是那么明显，就是磁性
been doing the final reason which is
maybe not so obvious is that magnetism

458
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:18,819
是研究物质各相之间相变的好地方，因此
is a really great place to study phase
transitions between phases of matter so

459
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:22,509
每个人都熟悉您在冰和水之间的相变或
everyone's familiar with your phase
transitions between ice and water or

460
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:25,599
水和蒸汽，您可能已经在热力学中研究了这些东西
water and steam and you probably studied
these things in your thermodynamics

461
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,069
上课，但是当真正开始了解这些阶段的细节时
classes but when one really gets down to
understanding the details of these phase

462
00:37:30,069 --> 00:37:33,880
我们对相变了解的大部分来自研究
transitions most of what we know about
phase transitions comes from studying

463
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,119
磁铁，可以更好地控制和更好地理解事物
magnets where things are much better
controlled and much better understood

464
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,140
关于冰融化成水的许多知识，我们实际上
and much of what we know about the
melting of ice into water we actually

465
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:45,489
知道，因为我们研究了磁铁，然后将知识转化为您
know because we studied magnets and then
we so translated our knowledge into you

466
00:37:45,489 --> 00:37:49,269
知道对冰和水的了解不是显而易见的，我们将做出
know understanding ice and water that's
not an obvious statement we will make

467
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:53,319
如果您继续学习，则对本课程中的相变有一些陈述
some statements about phase transitions
in this course if you go on to study

468
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:58,569
其他课程，您将学到很多有关的知识，所以让我们先定义一下
other courses you'll learn a lot more
about it okay so let's start by defining

469
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,650
两种类型的磁性我们将要工作的磁性类型
a couple of types of magnetism types of
magnetism that we're going to be working

470
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,569
或至少一些我们需要的磁性类型
on of magnetism or at least some of the
types of magnetism we're going to need

471
00:38:07,569 --> 00:38:13,690
要知道通常我们要做的是对某个物体施加磁场
to know about usually what we do is we
apply a magnetic field to some object

472
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:20,170
我们测量oops，我们测量磁化强度M，并且有一个比例
and we measure oops we measure a
magnetization M and there's a proportion

473
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,279
如果存在比例常数，我们称比例为Chi 
that if there's a proportionality
constant we call the proportionality Chi

474
00:38:24,279 --> 00:38:29,729
零零散散的地方，气被称为磁化率或磁化
over mu naught where Chi is known as the
susceptibility or magnetic

475
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:35,489
易感性我要拼写错误的USC Sept能力Sept能力
susceptibility I'm going to spell that
wrong s USC Sept ability Sept ability

476
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:43,960
零磁通是通常的磁导率
and nu naught is the usual magnetic
permeability the thing that's

477
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,770
渗透数据表上的东西
permeability
the thing that's on your datasheet and

478
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:57,480
您的考试是这样定义的，有两种磁性
your exams so given that as a definition
there's a couple kinds of magnetism that

479
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,380
你可以有一个是功率磁，这意味着或功率磁是任何
you can have one is power magnetism
which means or power magnet is any

480
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,150
 chi大于零的材料，换句话说，您施加了磁场
material with chi greater than zero in
other words you apply a magnetic field

481
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,900
你会在与磁场相同的方向上获得磁矩
and you get a magnetic moment in the
same direction as the field that you

482
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,500
应用似乎似乎有一定道理，我们已经知道
applied which seems to make some amount
of sense and we have know a couple of

483
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,990
该示例示例的示例是自由旋转，可能在
examples of that example example one is
a free spin probably studied this in

484
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,710
去年的统计力学，如果您有自由旋转的机会， 
statistical mechanics last year if you
have a free spin sort is sitting in

485
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,599
如果向外部空间施加磁场，则其能量会降低
outer space if you apply a magnetic
field to it its energy is lower if the

486
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,050
磁矩指向与磁场相同的方向，因此自旋
magnetic moment points in the same
direction as magnetic field so the spin

487
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:40,770
将尝试翻转并指向与磁场相同的方向，并且
will try to flip over and point in the
same direction as the magnetic field and

488
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:48,270
自由自旋是一个功率磁体，在前面我们研究过的第二个示例中
the free spin is a power magnet um
example two which we studied earlier in

489
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,700
这个术语是费米气体我们的电子气体我们应该研究Sommerfeld模型
this term is a Fermi gas our electron
gas we should study the Sommerfeld model

490
00:39:53,700 --> 00:40:00,690
我们发现有一种称为多功率磁性的磁性
and we found known as poly power
magnetism our magnetism there was some

491
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:06,180
计算结果与之基本相同
calculation which went along with that
it's basically exactly the same physics

492
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,200
你有一束电子，你在瞬间施加磁场
you have a bunch of electrons you apply
magnetic field the moments of the

493
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,349
电子想要与磁场对准以降低能量，但是
electrons want to align with the
magnetic field to lower the energy but

494
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:17,280
由于保利（Pauli）排除原则，他们不能全部翻身，所以只有少数
they can't all flip over because of the
Pauli exclusion principle so only a few

495
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
他们翻转，但仍然发展出的磁化强度
of them flip over but nonetheless the
magnetization that develops is in the

496
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,910
与施加的磁场方向相同，所以这是一种力量
same direction as the magnetic field
that's been applied so this is a power

497
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:27,420
磁铁我会比自由旋转弱一点，因为只有一些
magnet I'll be at a weaker one than the
free spin because only some of the

498
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:34,319
在费米气体的情况下，电子将翻转。好吧，我们将详细介绍
electrons will flip over in the case of
a Fermi gas okay we'll say more about

499
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:40,440
不久之后，另一种常见的磁性是
those in a little while so another type
of magnetism which is common is

500
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:48,000
反磁性，基本上意味着Chi小于零，换句话说， 
diamagnetism which basically means Chi
is less than zero in other words when

501
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,890
你施加磁场，磁矩想指向相反的方向
you apply magnetic field the magnetic
moment wants to point in the opposite

502
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:56,010
方向作为磁场现在我们可能不知道任何例子
direction as the magnetic field now we
may not know any examples of that

503
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,210
立即出现，但在质量上有相似之处
immediately but there's something that's
qualitatively similar

504
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:09,160
我们确实像伦茨定律一样定性地知道，您可能从第一年起就记得
we do know qualitatively like Lenz's law
which you may remember from first year

505
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,020
 EMM镜片法则提醒您，如果使用磁性材料，则如果您有电线圈， 
EMM lenses law to remind you if you have
a loop of wire if you apply a magnetic

506
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,760
导线回路的磁场将在该导线回路中流动，以与
field to the loop of wire currents will
flow in that loop of wire to oppose the

507
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:23,119
磁场，所以你在相反的方向发展磁矩
magnetic field so you're developing a
magnetic moment in the opposite

508
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,690
磁场变化的方向导线环不是
direction of the change in magnetic
field a loop of wire however is not a

509
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:33,920
磁铁的原因是因为你会产生一个磁矩
diamagnet the reason for this is because
that you'll develop a magnetic moment

510
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,160
但最终电流和电线将衰减并下降至零， 
but eventually the current and the wire
will will decay and go down to zero and

511
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,490
您将不会在导线中留下任何磁性力矩，因此实际上它没有磁性
you'll have no magnetic moment left in
the wire so in fact it's not magnetic at

512
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:48,380
它没有磁矩，除非导线是没有导体的超导体
all it has no magnetic moment unless the
wire is a superconductor which has no

513
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,069
电阻电流永不衰减，电流将持续流动
resistance currents never decay and the
current would keep flowing around

514
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:56,359
永远，直到永远，而磁矩将永远留在那里
forever and ever and ever and and the
magnetic moment would stay there forever

515
00:41:56,359 --> 00:41:59,720
而且那是一个真正的反磁铁，我们今年不研究超导体
and ever and that's a real diamagnet we
don't study superconductors this year

516
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,960
很高兴知道您可以用超导体做到这一点， 
just nice to know that that you could do
this with a superconductor you can get a

517
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,369
无论如何，反磁物理学实际上是真正的垫子反磁铁
real mat diamagnet anyway that the
physics of diamagnetism is actually

518
00:42:07,369 --> 00:42:11,359
在性质上与镜片定律非常相似，但是当您添加
quite similar qualitatively to the
physics of lenses law but when you add

519
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,040
您可以通过某种解释了解量子力学
quantum mechanics to it you kind of you
know in some interpretation you can

520
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,420
认为这些潮流永远被困在那儿并且总是在对立
think of these currents as being being
stuck there forever and always opposing

521
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,140
磁场，即使您知道何时会镜片定律
the magnetic field even when you you
know when you it would lenses law you

522
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,740
必须不断改变磁场以使电流持续流过
have to keep changing the magnetic field
to get the current to keep flowing in a

523
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,490
只要磁场保持在电流上，反磁铁就应
diamagnet as long as the magnetic field
stays on the current the current should

524
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:38,210
保持流动，所以我们会在第三种情况下看到这种情况
keep flowing so we'll see how that
happens in a bit okay the third case

525
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:46,960
我们需要知道的是铁磁体的情况
that we need to know about is the case
of a Ferro magnet which is when

526
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:55,700
即使B等于零，磁化强度也不等于零，例如
magnetization is not equal to zero
even when B equals zero something like

527
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,900
铁具有此属性粘在冰箱上的东西是
iron has this property the thing that
sticks to your refrigerator this is the

528
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:04,280
当我们想到磁铁时，我们通常认为它是磁铁
thing that we usually think of as a
magnet when we think about magnets so a

529
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:10,579
开始研究磁性的好地方是一次一个原子，因此我们将
good place to start our study of
magnetism is one atom at a time so we'll

530
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:18,410
从原子磁性开始，我们将建立
start with atomic magnetism
atomic magnetism and we'll build up to

531
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:25,170
真实材料的磁性，我应该知道吗？ 
magnetism of real materials and I should
you know put it in this caveat that we

532
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:35,160
我们总是会忽略无视原子核的磁性。 
always will we will ignore ignore the
magnetism of nuclei nuclear nuclei all

533
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,790
在一起，而我们忽略原子核的原因是，如果您考虑
together and the reason why we ignore
the nuclei is that if you think about

534
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:45,599
玻尔磁子给定的某个物体的磁矩是两个M 
the magnetic moment of some object it's
given by the Bohr Magneton we're two M

535
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,829
电子对象的数量，这大致取决于G因子，即
of the object for an electron this is
roughly the up to the G factor this is

536
00:43:52,829 --> 00:43:57,540
电子的磁矩对于核子和质子， 
the magnetic moment of an electron it's
similar for a nucleon and a proton or

537
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,700
中子，但进入这里的质量大千分之一或
neutron but the mass that enters in here
is bigger by a factor of a thousand or

538
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:06,869
两千左右，这样你从
two thousand or something so that the
magnetic moment that you get from a

539
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:11,040
原子核比你得到的磁矩小得多
nucleus is much much much much much
smaller than the magnetic moment you get

540
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,970
来自电子，这就是为什么我们通常不关心磁性的原因
from electrons and that's why we're
usually not concerned with the magnetism

541
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:19,530
原子核有时在那里很重要，特别是如果
of nuclei it is there it's sometimes
turns out to be important especially if

542
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:23,220
您正在考虑温度极低的事物，或者
you're thinking about things at
extremely low temperatures or if you're

543
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,880
看着非常微妙和出色的效果，您确实需要担心
looking at very very subtle and fine
effect you do have to worry about the

544
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,569
原子核的磁性，但对我们来说，我们只会担心
magnetism of nuclei but for us we're
only gonna be worried about about the

545
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:35,670
电子的磁性，因为它更大，所以我们要
magnetism of the electrons because it's
just much bigger okay so we're going to

546
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:40,200
忽略原子核，然后我们就必须以写法开始
ignore the nuclei and then we have to
start the way we always start by writing

547
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,660
用哈密顿量来表示原子中的电子，所以我写哈密顿量
down a Hamiltonian for the electrons in
the atom so I'll write the Hamiltonian

548
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,900
哈密​​顿量，对哈密顿量使用某种脚本H是常规做法
Hamiltonian and it's conventional to use
sort of a script H for the Hamiltonian

549
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:53,130
因此您不会将其与磁感应强度H混淆，您知道B和H 
so you don't get it confused with a
magnetic induction H you know B and H

550
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,710
还有你和那种东西，所以我们用汉密尔顿字母H 
and you and that kind of stuff so we use
a script H for the Hamiltonian and we'll

551
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:04,020
希望以您以前见过的方式写出来，所以有一个动力学术语P 
write it in hopefully ways that you've
seen before so there's a kinetic term P

552
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:11,670
加上EA平方超过2m，其中a是矢量电势del交叉a是B 
plus EA squared over 2m where a is the
vector potential del cross a is B

553
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,410
无论我决定对系统施加什么磁场， 
whatever magnetic field I decide to
apply to the system then there's going

554
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:19,920
就是这样，这只是动能，那么将会有一个吸引力
to be so this is just the kinetic energy
then there's going to be an attraction

555
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,010
到R的核V和我们之前见过的最后一项
to the nucleus V of R and the last term
we've seen before

556
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:35,450
 g ub b点sigma，这在um两端的术语上是相同的，也许一个
g ub b dot sigma and this is the same on
the term same on um two ends maybe one

557
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:44,300
结束有人知道结束语谢谢你，周一词是我的笔记我的笔记说我的
end anyone know what one end thank you
de mon term is my notes my notes say my

558
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:49,970
笔记不要说还可以，所以这个词告诉你
notes don't say it okay alright so this
is the term that tells you that the

559
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,530
如果电子指向电子的磁矩是较低的能量
magnetic moment of the electron is lower
energy if the electron points in the

560
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:57,830
如果磁矩指向相同方向，则方向相同
same direction if the magnetic moment
points in the same direction of magnetic

561
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,960
字段，这变得非常令人困惑，迹象变得非常令人困惑，请记住
field this gets very confusing the signs
get very confusing here remember that

562
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,280
电子自旋的磁矩指向与其相反的方向
the magnetic moment of an electron spin
points in the opposite direction of its

563
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,640
磁矩，因为电子上的电荷为负
magnetic moment because the charge on
the electron is negative okay

564
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,370
所以看起来这里的能量会更低
so it looks as if the energy would be
lower here when the so here here the

565
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,090
如果Sigma与B方向相反，则能量较低
energy is lower if Sigma is in the
opposite direction of B so it's pointing

566
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:23,030
方向相反，所以它是负数，但如果Sigma相反
in the opposite direction so it's
negative but if Sigma is in the opposite

567
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,940
方向是B磁矩实际上是Sigma的相反方向
direction is B the magnetic moment is
actually the opposite direction of Sigma

568
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,390
因此磁矩指向与BI知道减号的方向相同的方向
so the magnetic moment is pointing the
same direction as B I know minus signs

569
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,320
你知道我的死好吗B是电子的玻尔磁子
are you know the death of me okay mu B
is the Bohr Magneton for the electron

570
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:42,110
 G是G因子，通常只需要2就可以了，怎么办
and G is the G factor which will usually
take to be just 2 all right so what do

571
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:46,250
我们做得很好，我们真的很想治疗磁场
we do with this well we're really would
like to treat the magnetic field a

572
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:50,600
如果可以的话，请稍作扰动，以便您知道我们将以
little bit as a perturbation if we could
so you know that we'll start by

573
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:58,100
用以下方式重写此哈密顿量H等于P平方2m 
rewriting this Hamiltonian as in the
following way H equals P squared over 2m

574
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:06,350
加上R的V，即H 0或B的H等于0 
plus V of R and that is just H 0 or H of
B equals zero separate out that term

575
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:12,290
首先，我们还有几句话还没写，所以也许
first then we have a couple terms left
over that we didn't write yet so maybe

576
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:18,530
让我们在这里写这些或所有这些东西，然后我们再写
let's write those here plus or plus all
this stuff then we're gonna write next

577
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:26,020
所以一个是向量电位为2m P点a加上点P的交叉项
so one is the cross term with the vector
potential a over 2m P dot a plus a dot P

578
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:33,950
还有一个术语，向量电势平方超过2m平方， 
and then there's another term the vector
potential squared over 2m a squared and

579
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:38,359
那么我们在G UB上还有相同的期限
then we have the same on term left over
G UB

580
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:44,749
 B点Sigma，然后我们需要在这里做一些工作， 
B dot Sigma and then we have to do a
little bit of work here and one piece of

581
00:47:44,749 --> 00:47:48,229
我们需要做的工作是我们需要简化这个术语以及我们的方式
work we need to do is we need to sort of
simplify this term and the way we're

582
00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:54,349
要简化，那就是通过选择量规选择矢量量规
going to simplify that is by choosing a
gauge choose gauge for the vector

583
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:59,089
电位，而我要选择的量规是矢量电位
potential and the gauge I'm going to
choose is that the vector potential is

584
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:07,089
 1/2 B十字R，如果您这样选择，确实可以让您十字A 
1/2 B cross R and if you choose it like
that this this does give you del cross a

585
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:13,099
等于B，如果您这样选择，则A和P实际上通过
equals B if you choose it like this then
a and P actually commute through with

586
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,509
彼此，也许不是很明显看到这是真的，但这是真的
each other and it's maybe not so obvious
to see that that's true but it is true

587
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:24,229
因为a的X分量包含我们的y分量，所以X 
because the X component of a contains
the y component of our so the X

588
00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:29,089
计算的分量与P的X分量和交换。 
component of a compute commutes with the
with the X component component of P and

589
00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:31,579
这些是彼此相乘的，所以哪一个都没关系
those are the ones that are multiplied
by each other so it doesn't matter which

590
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:39,979
订购它们，以便选择此量规，然后我们可以将其改写为e 
order you put them in so choosing this
gauge we can then rewrite this as e over

591
00:48:39,979 --> 00:48:47,630
 2 m到点P，所以这两个人彼此上下班，然后我们将
2 m to a dot P so those two commute
right through each other and then we'll

592
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:54,380
用表达式写出一口井，我们将用1/2抵消两个，得到B 
write in our expression for a well we'll
cancel the two with the 1/2 and we get B

593
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:01,849
两端都标有P，我们使用三元产品标识将其重写为e 
across are dotted with P we use a triple
product identity to rewrite that as e

594
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:11,869
超过2m b点R交叉PR交叉P，然后仅吸收H bar的因数
over 2m b dot R cross P R cross P and
then just absorbing a factor of H bar

595
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:17,479
进入R十字P将识别出该物体为角动量并放
into the R cross P will recognize this
thing as in the angular momentum and put

596
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:27,499
 H棒在这里，所以我们得到mu B和B点L其中L是轨道角
the H bar up here so we get mu B and B
dot L where L is the orbital angular

597
00:49:27,499 --> 00:49:34,179
动量等于轨道角动量
momentum equals orbital angular momentum

598
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:43,429
因此，将所有这些放在一起，最终得到最终的哈密顿量
so putting this all together we end up
with the final Hamiltonian that we're

599
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:49,720
要与哈密顿量一起工作的是哈密顿量，其V等于0加
going to work with the Hamiltonian is
the Hamiltonian at V equals 0 plus

600
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:57,970
几个项emuebie点缀着轨道角动量加G倍
couple terms emuebie be dotted with the
orbital angular momentum plus G times

601
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:04,240
自旋角动量再加上这一项，我们将d平方
the spin angular momentum Plus this one
more term that we're left out d squared

602
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:13,690
超过2m的平方，我想也许我们应该在那儿停下来，下次再取车
over 2m a squared and I guess maybe we
should stop there and pick up next time

603
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:17,290
用这个哈密顿量，我们将分析磁场对此的影响
with this Hamiltonian and we'll analyze
the effect of the magnetic field on this

604
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:23,380
哈密​​尔顿人好吧，明天见，别忘了开会
Hamiltonian okay see you tomorrow
don't forget the meetings meeting right

605
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,849
讲完P JCC之后，还有像今天下午在
after the lecture P JCC and then also
the hinds like you did this afternoon at

606
00:50:27,849 --> 00:50:30,340
下午5点寻找太阳系外行星或
5 p.m.
searching for extrasolar planets or

607
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:34,920
好的再见[鼓掌] 
something okay bye
[Applause]
