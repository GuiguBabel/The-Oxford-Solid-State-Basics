1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
好吧，我想我们可以开始了，现在可以开始了欢迎回到13号
all right I guess we can get we can get
started now welcome back it's the 13th

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,780
上次我们停下来谈话时的浓缩物质课程演讲
lecture of the condensed matter course
when last we left off we were talking

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,509
关于散射的基本实验是，您有一些样品，在
about scattering the basic experiment is
you have some sample you have a wave at

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,289
一些波矢量K，您将其发送到样本中，然后散开
some wave vector K that you send into
the sample and then it's scattered off

5
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,150
到一些波向量K Prime上，并测量多少
to some wave vector K Prime and by
measuring how much and in what

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,960
您有分散的方向，您可以推断出什么
directions you have scattering you're
able to deduce something about what's

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,980
实际上，在样本中，我们对这些类型的
actually in the sample a couple of
things that we know about these type of

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,040
首先进行散射实验，以便从k到k进行散射
scattering experiments first of all in
order to get scattering from k to k

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,200
素数必须有K减去K素数等于倒数晶格向量G和
prime you must have K minus K prime
equal a reciprocal lattice vector G and

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:47,520
我们在上一讲中得出的等效条件是布拉格条件
we derived in the last lecture that's
equivalent to be Bragg condition to be

11
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,270
正弦theta等于和lambda换句话说，因为倒易晶格
sine theta equals and lambda in other
words since the reciprocal lattice

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,719
向量与晶格平面族正交
vector is orthogonal to a family of
lattice planes what you're actually

13
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,309
从具有晶格面间距D的衍射光栅上衍射
getting is diffraction off a diffraction
grating with lattice plane spacing D

14
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,630
正交于该向量G的散射强度
orthogonal to that vector G the
intensity of scattering at any

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,950
倒易晶格矢量与结构因子成正比
reciprocal lattice vector is
proportional to the structure factor of

16
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,270
 d平方，其中结构因子是散射的傅立叶变换
d squared where the structure factor is
the Fourier transform of the scattering

17
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,409
单位晶格中的电位，因此该强度使您
potential in the unit cell so this
intensity gives you some amount of

18
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,479
有关单位单元中实际存在的信息的信息
information about what's actually in the
unit cell now how you actually do this

19
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
实验要复杂一些，可以采用几种方法
experiment is a little more complicated
there's several methods one can go about

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,909
有第一种方法是最好的方法，但也是最困难的方法
there is the first method which is the
best method but also the hardest method

21
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,780
最佳但最困难的方法，我将仅就最佳方法进行简要讨论，但
best but hardest which I'll discuss only
very briefly for the best method but

22
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:47,070
最困难的方法是使用单晶硅
also the hardest method is to use a
single crystal single crystal so single

23
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,119
晶体看起来像这样，这是钠的华丽单晶
crystals look like this this is a
gorgeous single crystal of sodium

24
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,509
氯化物一大块没有任何缺陷的材料现在是什么
chloride a big single piece of the
material without any defects now what

25
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,479
你会发现，所以你把你的单晶放在你的路径
you'll find so you take your single
crystal you put it in the path of your

26
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,640
你的波浪，你寻找我们的波浪从它散落的东西，你
of your wave and you look for for our
waves being scattered off of it what you

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,568
发现的是，如果您付钱拿单晶，您可以任意放
find is if you pay take your single
crystal you put it in some arbitrary

28
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:13,590
在您的光束前方定向，以获得最大定向
orientation in front of your your beam
here for a most orientation

29
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,340
您根本不会有任何分散，换句话说，您将无法对齐
you won't get any scattering at all in
other words you will not manage to align

30
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,269
正好成直角的晶格族
the families of lattice planes just at
the right angle such that the Bragg

31
00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:25,319
条件是实际满足的，所以为了得到任何散射
condition is actually satisfied so in
order to actually get any scattering

32
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,920
您需要做的是旋转晶体旋转晶体
what you need to do is to rotate the
crystal rotate the crystal another way

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,860
得到散射是改变波长，非常λ做一个或
to get scattering is to vary the
wavelengths very lambda do one or the

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,150
其他，然后在晶体的某个角度或在波的某个值
other and then at some angle of the
crystal or at some value of the wave

35
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,630
得到散射的长度，然后写下获得散射的方向
length you get scattering you write down
in which direction to get the scattering

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,810
您可以测量散射的强度，并可以推断出很多
you measure the intensity of the
scattering and you can deduce a lot of

37
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,610
有关结构因素的信息，因此有关
information about the structure factor
and therefore about the structure of the

38
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,530
现在，我们实际上不会讨论如何在任何情况下分析此类数据
crystal now we're not actually going to
go into how you analyze such data in any

39
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,220
本课程中的细节，而我们不打算这样做的原因是因为
detail in this course and the reason
we're not going to do it is because this

40
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,390
方法很少使用，之所以很少使用是因为
method is very rarely used and the
reason it's very rarely used is because

41
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,890
这实际上是最难的事情，因为这很难，因为
it's actually the hardest thing to do
the reason it's hard is because almost

42
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:15,120
无一例外的材料不喜欢形成漂亮的大晶体钠
without exception materials don't like
to form nice big crystals sodium

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,790
氯化物是一个建议，你有这些美丽的钠大晶体
chloride is a suggest and you have these
beautiful big crystals of sodium

44
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,540
氯化石英可以制成漂亮的大晶体，您知道您可能可以制成漂亮的晶体
chloride quartz makes nice big crystals
you know you can probably make a nice

45
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,019
大块的糖晶体，我的意思是，所以有几种材料
big crystal of sugar something I mean so
there are a couple of materials that you

46
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,590
可以形成漂亮的大晶体，但是如果您煮一些，大多数材料就不会
can get to form a nice big crystals but
most materials don't if you cook up some

47
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,180
您实验室中的新材料，或者您通常会在自然界中发现一些新材料
new material in your laboratory or you
find some new material in nature usually

48
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,680
它不是结晶它不会经常形成大晶体它是粉末甚至是
it's not crystalline it doesn't form big
crystals frequently it's powder or even

49
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,950
更糟糕的是，您可以拥有所谓的多晶，所以这是
worse than that you can have what's
known as polycrystalline so this is a

50
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,760
多晶材料的图片，其中有微小的小晶体
picture of a polycrystalline material
where you have tiny little crystal

51
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,139
大约一微米大小的灯，所以这里有一个小水晶
lights which are about on the size of a
micron so there's a little crystal here

52
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:52,620
一点水晶般清晰，那些水晶的轴方向错误
a little crystal clear and those
crystals have their axes Mis oriented

53
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,410
彼此之间，它们都被弄脏了
with respect to each other and they're
all sort of smushed together you can

54
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,519
认为它就像是粘在一起的微小小晶体粉末， 
think of it as like a powder of tiny
little crystals all stuck together and

55
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,450
通常，当您制作材料时，其外观如下所示： 
typically materials look like this when
you make them it's very very difficult

56
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,780
需要非常好的化学家和非常好的材料科学家
it takes a very good chemist and very
good material scientist to turn

57
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,430
看起来像这样的东西看起来像这样的东西
something that looks like this into
something that looks like this so most

58
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,639
在做一个实验的时候人们正在做某事
of the time when one is doing the
experiment one is working with something

59
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:18,480
看起来像是多晶的，所以两个
that looks like this it's
polycrystalline so two

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,560
要使用多晶样品获取数据，您可以使用所谓的德拜
to take data on a polycrystalline sample
you use what's known as the Debye

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,620
 Scherer提出的Scherer方法
Scherer method due by Scherer

62
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,560
作者是来自Debye振动和固体理论的人Scherer 
the by is the same guy from the Debye
theory of vibrations and solids Scherer

63
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,330
显然是别人，德拜警长法也叫火药
someone else obviously and the Debye
sheriff method is also known as powder

64
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:50,580
衍射衍射，因为您可以使用多种材料的粉末
diffraction diffraction because you can
use a powder of the material lots of

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,720
微小的小小的水晶灯在粉末中，你可以把它放在你的
tiny tiny little crystal lights in a
powder and you can put that in your

66
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,690
采样并从中获取数据，现在就真正理解它了
sample and get data out of it and
actually make sense of it now the

67
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,770
粉末衍射或在其上进行衍射的思想的一般原理
general principle of the idea of powder
diffraction or doing diffraction on

68
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,020
多晶样品是如果您要向您的产品中发送电波
polycrystalline samples is if you're
sending a wave into your into your

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,070
水晶在这里，如果你想像了一秒钟，你会得到一个大生物，一个大单身
crystal here if you imagine for a second
you got a big critter a big single

70
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,750
晶体，如果有任何晶体，您可以旋转该晶体
crystal and you could rotate that single
crystal around if there was any

71
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,390
他旋转单晶的方向，你会得到
direction in which he rotated that
single crystal and you could get

72
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,770
以该角度衍射出来，然后在粉末中的某处
diffraction out at this angle then
somewhere in your powder somewhere in

73
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,790
您的多晶样品的轴将在其他方向正确定向
your polycrystalline sample the axes
will be correctly oriented in other

74
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,630
多晶材料或粉末代表一切可能
words the poly crystal material or the
powder represents every possible

75
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,430
材料的方向，因此在材料的某个地方会有情况
orientation of the material so somewhere
in your material you'll have a situation

76
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,200
您的晶格平面族以正确的方式按顺序对齐
where your family of lattice planes is
aligned just in the right way in order

77
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,180
如果有任何方向可以做到从K到K Prime的衍射
to get diffraction from K to K Prime if
there's any orientation that will do it

78
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,320
您会在您的某处找到正确方向的水晶灯
you'll find that crystal light with the
right orientation somewhere in your

79
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,960
样本好吧，这是我们要遵循的一般原则
sample okay
that's the general principle we're gonna

80
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,760
如果你能在这个方向上得到一些衍射
live by now if if you can get
diffraction in this direction with some

81
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,110
通过这种方式平行排列的晶格平面，您还可以想象
lattice planes that are sort of lined up
parallel this way you can also imagine

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,880
如果您以这种方式排列晶格平面，则可能会衍射出来
that if you lined up your lattice planes
this way you could get diffraction out

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,920
这样，实际上您可以想象绕着旋转水晶灯
this way and in fact you can imagine
rotating those crystal lights around the

84
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,370
入射轴，您意识到可以获得整个衍射锥
incoming axis and you realize that you
can get a whole cone of diffraction

85
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,730
如果有可以分散的方向，可以向外旋转
outwards if there's any direction that
you can scatter you can rotate that

86
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,650
进入通道周围的水晶灯，并得到圆锥形的出射波
crystal light around the incoming access
and get a get a cone of outgoing waves

87
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,870
因此，实验实际在设置中的外观就像这样
so the way the experiment actually looks
in a set up is kind of like this there's

88
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,420
入射的X射线有多晶和粉末
an incident x-ray
there's a poly crystal and a powder

89
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,910
粉末状的标本在这里，然后您得到这些圆锥形的出射波， 
powdered specimen here and then you get
these cones of outgoing waves which you

90
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,290
然后尝试衡量一下​​，请记住在此处标记了该标记，这样您就不会忘记
then try to measure remember that the
it's marked here so you don't forget the

91
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:48,420
总偏转角为2θ非常重要
total deflection angle is 2 theta very
important a common source of source of

92
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,470
错误和2 theta可以从零到任何地方，这意味着它根本不会分散
error and 2 theta can go anywhere from
zero meaning it's not scattered at all

93
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,290
到180度，这意味着它已经像以前那样直接反向散射
to 180 degrees meaning it's directly
backscattered now the way one used to

94
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:02,610
测量它是您将采用这种圆形环境，并且您将
measure it is you would take this sort
of round environment and you would line

95
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:06,870
里面装有相纸，您只需将相纸曝光
the inside with photographic paper and
you just expose the photographic paper

96
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,450
看到X射线，您会看到这些圆锥形信号发出
to the x-rays and you can see these nice
conical signals coming out for these

97
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,040
从您的多晶样品中得出各种不同的锥体
various different cones coming out like
this from your polycrystalline sample

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,380
但在现代，不使用相纸的数量更多
but in modern days photographic paper is
not used it's much more it's much more

99
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,680
方便，实际上更准确，使用起来更灵敏
convenient and actually much more
accurate and much more sensitive to use

100
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,220
半导体探测器，因此通常是您实际从样品中得到的
semiconductor detectors so it's usually
what you actually get out of your sample

101
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,810
现在您的实验中出现的是这样的情节， 
out of your experiment now is a plot
that looks like this where what's

102
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,800
绘制在底部的是散射角和强度
plotted across the bottom is a
scattering angle and the intensity

103
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,160
垂直，所以您会看到这里有一个二十度左右的峰
vertically so you'll see there's a peak
here at twenty-something degrees another

104
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,250
在30度左右达到峰值，可能与此环相对应，然后
peak at 30 something degrees which might
correspond to this ring and then that

105
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,480
响等等，这就是我们要花费他们的数据类型
ring and so forth and this is the kind
of data that we're going to spend their

106
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,820
时间分析还可以，所以这些都是经典问题的一种
time analyzing okay so these are sort of
sort of a classic type of question for

107
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,780
检查使用设备Scherer方法分析粉末衍射图
exams analyze a powder diffraction
pattern with the device Scherer method

108
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,130
因此，遵循此方法有一些规则，因此我将其写下来
so there's a couple rules for following
this method so I'll write them down it's

109
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:05,520
很难找到一本能很好地解释这本书的书
fairly difficult to find a book that
explains this well I think is explained

110
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,280
我的书很好，但是如果您不喜欢我的书中的解释，那您就很好
well in my book but if you don't like
the explanation in my book you're kind

111
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,540
之所以运气不好，是因为没有很多其他书籍对此有所解释
of out of luck because there aren't a
lot of other books that explain it so

112
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,550
对此感到抱歉，但事实就是如此
sorry about that but that's just how it
is

113
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,510
所以规则编号零是没有波长没有波长λ为什么你
so rule number zero is no the wavelength
no your wavelength lambda why do you

114
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:25,410
很好地了解您的波长λ，您就是放入X射线的实验者
know your wavelength lambda well you're
the experimentalist you put in the x-ray

115
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:29,670
您拥有X射线设备的光束，因此您大概知道
beam you had the x-ray apparatus so you
know presumably what the wavelength of

116
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:33,510
 X射线很重要，所以最好从没有波长开始
the x-ray is so it's a good thing to
start with no your wavelength probably

117
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:37,770
如果您是优秀的实验师，那么实际上可以很准确地知道它
know it pretty accurately actually if
you're a good experimentalist step one

118
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:45,189
测量角度测量角度散射角
measure the angles
measure angles angle of scattering which

119
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:49,990
是两个theta都没有theta记住这很重要，所以这里有一些
is two theta naught theta remember that
it's gonna be important so here's some

120
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,839
数据，我们实际上将要分析他们完成前两个步骤的位置
data we're actually going to analyze
where they've done the first two steps

121
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,740
因为这是铝，他们在散布铝
for this is aluminum they're doing
scattering off of or aluminium I guess

122
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,800
在这个国家，波长在这方面是非常精确的
in this country and the the wavelength
is known extremely precisely in this

123
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,420
设置是通过典型的X射线管完成的，您知道自己有六位数
setup this is done with a typical x-ray
tube and you know you have six digits of

124
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,379
他们知道波长的精确度要记住
precision as to how much how precisely
they know the wavelength remember the

125
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,699
他们如此精确地知道其波长的原因是因为这是
reason they know their wavelength so
precisely is because this is an

126
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:19,029
原子中两个本征态之间的电子跃迁是电子
electronic transition between two
eigenstates in an atom it's an electron

127
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:23,050
从一个本征态下降到另一个本征态，所以能量是
falling down from one eigen state to
another eigen state so the energies are

128
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,310
这些本征态非常精确地定义，所以您知道
those eigen states are very very
precisely defined so you so you know the

129
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,110
波长非常高的精度，那么您就会知道所有这些数据
wavelength with very high precision then
you you know you get this data all these

130
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,310
峰值是散射角2θ的函数，幸运的是
Peaks as a function of scattering angle
2 theta and fortunately in this

131
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,060
一张特定的图片他们实际上为我们测量了38个角度
particular picture they've actually
measured the angles for us thirty-eight

132
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,509
点四三度四十四点六七度，依此类推， 
point four three degrees forty four
point six seven degrees and so forth and

133
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:46,809
我还用字母标记了峰，以便我们跟踪它们。 
I've also labeled the peaks with letters
so we can keep track of them peak a peak

134
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:52,480
 C峰等等，只是一个提示，如果您曾经服用过粉末
peak C and so forth just a one hint that
if you're ever given a powder

135
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,259
衍射图样，您必须自己测量角度
diffraction pattern and you have to
measure the angles yourself it will

136
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,889
如果您获得非常精确的角度，对您有很大帮助
really help a lot if you get the angles
very precise if you get the angles off

137
00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:03,279
一点点，你会很困惑，这不会很明显
by a little bit you can get very
confused it won't be obvious what the

138
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,019
结果应该是这样，请尝试尽可能精确地对其进行测量
result is supposed to be so try to
measure it as precisely as you can okay

139
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:14,250
所以对于每个散射角，您要测量步长两个角
so for each scattering angle you measure
step two angle sorry

140
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:21,399
角度，所以第二步是计算晶格平面间距
angle so step two is calculate the
lattice plane spacing so lattice plane

141
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:33,610
使用布拉格定律确定平面间距，即d等于2上的lambda 
spacing plane spacing using Bragg's law
and that is d equals lambda over two

142
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,529
正弦θ好，所以对于每个散射角
sine theta
okay so for each scattering angle you

143
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,860
看到它代表间距D等于的一族晶格平面
see that's representing a family of
lattice planes with the spacing D equals

144
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,529
 Lambda超过两个正弦θ，现在您可能会认为它应该是n 
lambda over two sine theta
now you might think it should be n

145
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,100
 Lambda超过两个正弦波theta，但实际上您不需要在这里结束，因为
lambda over two sine theta but in fact
you don't need the end up here because

146
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,850
 n的较高值将对应于不同的Thetas 
the higher values of n will correspond
to different Thetas that you will also

147
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,920
测量一下，所以如果放在楼上，那你就结束了
measure so you'll just be over
if you put in an upstairs so you just

148
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,740
需要将λ保持在2个正弦θ以上，每个角度对应一个
need to keep lambda over 2 sine theta
each angle corresponds to one one

149
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,070
晶格平面间距好吧，所以第三步，对我们来说这是
lattice plane spacing okay all right so
step three so this is for us this is

150
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,290
不在现实世界中，我们可以假设某种立方
sort of not in the real world we can
assume cubic of some sort assume cubic

151
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,960
在现实世界中，对简单立方的含义实际上不是一个坏假设
it's actually not a bad assumption in
the real world to meaning simple cubic

152
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:27,000
我在25年的考试中从未见过的简单BCC或FCC 
simple BCC or FCC I have never seen in
25 years of exams I have never seen a

153
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,200
要求您找出粉末衍射图的三年级考试
third-year exam that is asked you to
figure out a powder diffraction pattern

154
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,100
对于比简单立方BCC或FCC更复杂的事情， 
for anything more complicated than
simple cubic BCC or FCC those are the

155
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,850
您在三年级考试中只会碰到的格子几乎是一个承诺
only lattices you'll run into on your
third year exam that's almost a promise

156
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,060
我的意思是您当然知道他们第一次可以做些什么，但是
I mean of course you know they could do
something for the first time but but

157
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,400
你很漂亮，这是一个很好的假设，那就是你永远不会
you're pretty it's pretty good
assumption that this is all you're never

158
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,610
会在现实世界中碰到的是，你会碰到更多的东西
gonna run into in the real world it's
you'll run into things that are more

159
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,060
复杂，但以此为前提开始，如果
complicated but it's not a bad thing to
start with this as an assumption and if

160
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,520
您无法获取适合这些数据的数据，然后继续进行更复杂的操作
you can't get the data to fit these then
you go on to more complicated

161
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,700
假设立方的可能性还可以，我们也将记住
possibilities all right assuming cubic
we also have will remember that the

162
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,450
晶格平面间距这是我们根据米勒得出的
lattice plane spacing this is something
we derived corresponding to Miller

163
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:10,230
指数HKL是晶格常数a除以H平方的平方根
indices HKL is the lattice constant a
divided by the square root of H squared

164
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:14,730
加K平方加l平方这是我们最后得出的结果
plus K squared plus l squared it's
something we derived I think in the last

165
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:20,640
讲座也许是之前的那一场，那么这给我们带来了什么呢？ 
lecture maybe the one before so what
does that give us that gives us that a

166
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:28,950
 d平方的平方是H平方加K平方加l平方现在我们不
squared over d squared is H squared plus
K squared plus l squared now we don't

167
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,360
知道是什么，我们将尝试找出答案，但我们知道许多DS 
know what a is yet we're gonna try to
figure it out but we know a bunch of DS

168
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,480
那么这是要告诉我们DS的比例将是这些HKS和elzar 
so is this gonna tell us the ratio of DS
are going to be these HKS and elzar

169
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,910
整数，所以1与d平方的比将是一个整数
integers so the ratio of 1 over d
squared are going to be an integer

170
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,630
比率确定，所以我们要声明这个东西H的平方加K 
ratios ok so we're going to declare this
thing this quantity H squared plus K

171
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:52,980
平方乘以l平方，我们将其称为N，然后让我们看看我们还有什么
squared over l squared we're gonna call
it N and step let's see what else we're

172
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,860
到第四步为止，我们将寻找整数的整数比率
stuff to up to step four we're going to
look for integer ratios for integer

173
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,310
比率
ratios

174
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:10,560
 n的比率，然后获得n的整数比率后，我们将寻找
ratios of n and then once we have the
integer ratios of n we will look for

175
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,300
选择规则寻找选择规则
selection rules look for selection rules

176
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,260
规则，规则，好的，让我们从最后回想一下
rules rules okay
so let's let's recall from the last

177
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,460
讲座如果我们有一个简单的三次方，将给HKL选择规则
lecture what the selection rules were
given HKL if we had a simple cubic

178
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:44,010
格子简单立方格子所有HKL允许所有HKL对应倒数
lattice simple cubic lattice all HKL are
allowed all HKL correspond to reciprocal

179
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:49,760
简单立方大声晶格的晶格矢量，因此全部允许
lattice vectors for the simple cubic
loud lattice so these are all allowed

180
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:57,390
对于BCC晶格，我们推导了选择规则：h加k加LL 
for a BCC lattice we derived the
selection rule that h plus k plus L L

181
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:06,330
对于FCC晶格，必须为偶数，必须为偶数。 
must be even must be even for an FCC
lattice we derived the selection rule

182
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:20,340
然后h KL全部为偶数或全为奇数，这样我们就可以开始制作一个
then h KL all even or all odd so we can
actually start making a table of the

183
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:26,330
实际上，可能我会把桌子放在这里
possibilities actually maybe I'll put
the table over here

184
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:32,750
所以在第一列上会把HKL放到最后一个家庭
so over first column will put HKL this
is the family possible families last

185
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:38,720
位置将写出n为H平方加K平方加l平方的数字n 
place will write the number n which is H
squared plus K squared plus l squared

186
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,780
然后我们将编写简单的立方BCC和FCC并询问是否允许使用
and then we'll write simple cubic BCC
and FCC and ask whether they're allowed

187
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,400
那么我们所说的最简单的最后一架飞机是什么
so what's the simplest possible family
of last planes we could be talking about

188
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,200
我们可能在说1 0 0，所以n H平方加K平方加l平方是
we could be talking about 1 0 0 so n H
squared plus K squared plus l squared is

189
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:59,030
 1个简单立方是允许所有简单立方
1 simple cubic
yes that's allowed for simple cubic all

190
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,140
 H平方加K允许​​所有HK和L用于简单立方BCC，这不是
H squared plus K all H K and L are
allowed for simple cubic BCC it's not

191
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,540
允许，因为1加0加0为奇数，所以这是不允许的FCC，因为
allowed because 1 plus 0 plus 0 is odd
so this is no FCC is not allowed because

192
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,960
它们不是全部都是奇数，甚至不是全部，所以FCC不允许下一个
they're not all odd or all even so it's
not allowed for FCC how about the next

193
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,450
最简单1 1 1 0 H平方加K平方加l平方为2简单立方
simplest 1 1 1 0 H squared plus K
squared plus l squared is 2 simple cubic

194
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:27,440
是的，这也允许BCC 1加1加0等于1加1加0是
well yes that's also allowed BCC well 1
plus 1 plus 0 is even 1 plus 1 plus 0 is

195
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,480
 2，所以允许，是FCC，这是不允许的，因为他们都不都是奇怪的人
2 so that's allowed yes FCC it's not
allowed because they're not all odd who

196
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:39,410
甚至一个一一对一的HBO Chris K Fidel平方是三
are all even one one one one
HBO Chris K Fidel squared is three it's

197
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:44,090
允许用于BCC的简单三次，这是不允许的，因为总和是奇数，但
allowed for simple cubic for BCC it's
not allowed because the sum is odd but

198
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:50,630
 FCC允许使用，因为它们都是奇数，然后2 0 0继续前进
it is allowed for FCC because they're
all odd then 2 0 0 keep going

199
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:56,030
所以2平方加0平方是4它允许简单立方的和是偶数
so 2 squared plus 0 squared is 4 it's
allowed for simple cubic the sum is even

200
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,530
所以这里允许，他们都可以，所以你可以
so it's allowed here and they're all
even so it's allowed here and you can

201
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,780
组成这些事情的一个大表值得跟踪
make up a big table of these things it's
worth doing to keep track of which

202
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:11,000
您应该从中观察Miller索引现在从哪种可能的晶格类型开始
Miller indices you should observe for
which possible lattice type now from

203
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,240
这种类型的表格可以列出可能的整数，并且您可以
this type of table you can make a list
of the possible integers and that you

204
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,850
会看到不同的晶格类型，因此对于简单立方立方
would see for the different lattice
types for so for simple cubic cubic you

205
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:34,370
得到，得到的可能结局是1 2 3 4 5 6 8所以7发生了什么
get and the possible ends you get are 1
2 3 4 5 6 8 so what happened to 7 so all

206
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,840
允许使用可能的HKS和ELL，但是您会发现是否尝试了
the possible HKS and ELLs are allowed
but you'll discover if you try there's

207
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,750
如果您将它们平方并拿走H就没有了
no H can
all that if you square them and take H

208
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,160
平方加K平方加l平方，您将得到7，但找不到它
squared plus K squared plus l squared
you'll get 7 you just can't find it sort

209
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,360
数论类型的结果，您只是找不到三个整数
of a number theory type of result that
you just can't find three integers that

210
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,870
当平方和加在一起就给你七个，所以七个不见了，依此类推
when squared and added together give you
seven so seven is missing and so forth

211
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:04,609
我认为下一个缺少的是BCC的15个BCC和2 4 6 8个
and I think the next one that's missing
is 15 for BCC for BCC and is 2 4 6 8 so

212
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,198
依此类推，我想缺少的第一个是28，实际上FCC是

213
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:20,750
最有趣的一个FCC系列是N等于3 3 4 8 11 12 16 16等等
most interesting one FCC the series is N
equals 3 3 4 8 11 12 16 16 and so forth

214
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,020
其实我想我已经把这些写下来了，是的，这不是
actually I think I wrote these all down
already yeah it's not on this on this

215
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:28,400
幻灯片，因此我们再次将整个表格写下来， 
slide so here's exactly building that
whole table again we wrote down the

216
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,660
该表的前四个元素这是端点正方形加K正方形加l 
first four elements of this table here's
the ends a square plus K square plus l

217
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:37,070
平方1 2 3 4 5 6到7时，没有米勒指数集
squared 1 2 3 4 5 6 when you get to 7
there's no set of Miller indices that

218
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,110
平方并加在一起得到7，然后您查看FCC以及
went squared and add together gives you
7 and you look at FCC and the possible

219
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:46,580
可能为您提供的FCC允许的Miller指数
the possible Miller indices that give
you that are allowed for FCC the first

220
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,980
第一个是1 1 1这些都是奇数，总共3个
the first one is 1 1 1 those are all odd
that that gives you a total of 3 the

221
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:56,419
允许的下一个是2 0 0这些全都等于2的平方
next one that's allowed is 2 0 0 those
are all even that gives you 2 squared

222
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:00,020
加0加0平方是4表示允许，下一个允许的是2 
plus 0 plus 0 squared is 4 that's
allowed the next one that's allowed is 2

223
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,150
 2 0全部偶数2平方加2平方加0平方等于8下一个是
2 0 all even 2 squared plus 2 squared
plus 0 squared is 8 the next one that's

224
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:11,120
允许的是3 1 1所有的奇数使您得到11，依此类推，所以这是系列
allowed is 3 1 1 all odd that gives you
11 and so forth so these are the series

225
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,730
我们想要寻找的，所以实际上让我们为这种铝做
that we want to want to look for so
actually let's do that for this aluminum

226
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,970
数据哦，他们在这里，所以这是写出来的系列1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 
data oh and they here so here's the
series written out 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9

227
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:29,030
缺少七十五和二十三我都连整数都不包括28 60和
missing seven fifteen and twenty three I
all even integer is excluding 28 60 and

228
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:33,440
依此类推，这并非巧合28恰好是7和60的4倍
so forth actually it's not a coincidence
of 28 happens to be 4 times 7 and 60

229
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,340
碰巧是15的4倍，您可以说服自己为什么如此
happens to be 4 times 15 you can
convince yourself why that's true and

230
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:45,160
那么FCC是3 4 8 11 12，以此类推，所以这又是数据
then FCC is 3 4 8 11 12 and and and so
forth okay so here's the data again

231
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,150
让我们一步一步地完成此过程，所以在这里我们测量了所有
let's go through this procedure all the
steps one by one so here we measured all

232
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:52,930
的角度或有人测量了四个
of the the angles or someone measured
four

233
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,120
这是他们很好的一面，所以让我们计算出所有这些角度的表D 
here is very nice of them here so make a
table of all these angles we calculate D

234
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,430
等于2正弦theta上的lambda，所以这里是所有2正弦theta上的lambda 
equals lambda over 2 sine theta so here
is the lambda over 2 sine theta for all

235
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:09,820
这些散射峰中的一个，那么我们得出以下结论：d平方上有108 
of these scattering Peaks then we have
this statement that 108 over d squared

236
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,940
在d平方上是H平方加K平方加l平方，我们想
over d squared is H squared plus K
squared plus l squared and we want to

237
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:18,250
求出1的平方的整数比率，所以我们要怎么做呢？ 
find integer ratios of 1 over d squared
so how do we do that well let's declare

238
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,900
这个数字在这里是2点3 4哦5埃，我们称之为D sub a 
this number here two point three four oh
five angstroms we'll call that D sub a

239
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,720
然后我们将D sub的表平方成d平方，其中D是全部
and we'll make a table of D sub a
squared over d squared where D is is all

240
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,350
这些D的可能值中的一个，因此第一个时隙在定义上为12.3平方
of these possible values of D so the
first slot is by definition 12.3 squared

241
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:38,860
在两点三平方上是一，但在第二个一两点三平方上
over two point three squared is one but
the second one two point three squared

242
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:42,490
在2点O 2平方上是1点3 3等等，依此类推
over two point O two squared is one
point three three and so forth and so on

243
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,060
我们在这张表中得到这些不是整数，但它们非常接近
we get this in this table here those
aren't integers but they're pretty close

244
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:49,690
整数，如果乘以三，则会得到一组
to integers if you're multiplying by
three you get a set of things that are

245
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,410
真的非常接近整数，您会发现该模式实际上是3 
really really close to integers and
you'll see that that pattern is really 3

246
00:19:53,410 --> 00:20:03,100
 4 8 11 12 16 1920这是FCC系列3 4 8 11 12 16 19 20 
4 8 11 12 16 1920 which is the FCC
series 3 4 8 11 12 16 19 20 so so we've

247
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:10,840
由此得出的结论是，我们发现铝的铝散射模式
concluded from this that the aluminum
the aluminum scattering pattern we found

248
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,390
对应于FCC晶格，我们实际上可以进一步
is corresponds to an FCC lattice we can
actually go on a little bit further to

249
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,610
计算晶格常数，所以这可能是步骤5 
calculate lattice constants so this
might be step 5

250
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:27,190
计算晶格常数，单位晶格常数a的大小为
calculate lattice constant the size of
the unit cell constant a which would be

251
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:32,830
 d乘以K平方的平方根再加上l平方再加上一个平方，因为我
d times the square root of K squared
plus l squared plus a squared because I

252
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,590
以错误的顺序做了一个正方形加K平方加L平方通常没事
did in the wrong order a square plus K
square plus l squared usually all right

253
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,800
同样的事情，如果我们这样做，那么哦，这是写下来的米勒指数
same thing and if we do that oh they're
the Miller indices written down for

254
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,540
它们是山峰，这是A，它们都差不多
their for the peaks and here's the A's
and they're all pretty close to the same

255
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,720
大约三到四位数，它们并不完全相同，所以可能
to about three or four digits they're
not exactly the same so there's probably

256
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,530
角度测量中出现了一些错误或类似的错误
some error in the measurement of the
angles or something like that has gone

257
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:58,300
错误，但在四位数的精度以内，我们已经测量了晶格
wrong but to within four digits of
accuracy we've measured the lattice

258
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,670
常数a表示铝还可以，所以现在一般来说就是这样
constant a for aluminum okay so that's
generally how it works now when you get

259
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,920
擅长于此，您甚至不必真正进行整个计算
good at this you don't even
have to really do this whole calculation

260
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,130
您可以看一下模式我非常清楚这是什么
you can sort of look at the pattern I
have a pretty good idea what it is so

261
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,990
哦，有铝，有
this
oh there's aluminum there there's the

262
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,950
 Miller索引标记正确，所以我将向您展示一种模式， 
the Miller indices labeled appropriately
so I'm going to show you a pattern and

263
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:28,440
无需进行任何计算，我们就能知道现在的晶格类型
without actually doing any calculation
we can tell what the lattice type is now

264
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,080
如果您给我一个理由，只是给我一个理由，只有三种可能性
there's only three possibilities if you
give me a reason just give me a reason a

265
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:39,720
简单三次，这是什么原因，很好的原因是什么，所以没有7是
simple cubic what's the reason very good
alright so that's a so no seven that's a

266
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,840
那是你的，所以你可以在这里看到第一个高峰，这样
that one's yours so you can see here
that the first peak so that the the

267
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,020
峰间距不完全均匀，这是因为正弦
spacing of the peaks is not completely
uniform and that's because of the sine

268
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:53,940
正弦theta的theta因子可让您在离开时获得更多空间
theta factor that sine theta sort of
spaces things out more when you're at

269
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:59,670
小角度比大角度，但您可以看到
low angles than it is it's at high
angles but but you can kind of see that

270
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:01,680
一从一到二的间距不是这样
one
the spacing from one to two isn't so

271
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,880
从2到3 3到4 4到5 5到6不同，但是有一个洞，其中7是
different from 2 to 3 3 to 4 4 to 5 5 to
6 but then there's a hole where 7 is

272
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,600
应该是然后8到9 10 11 12，你看他们是否真的有一个
supposed to be and then 8 to 9 10 11 12
and you see if they actually there's a

273
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,570
孔应该在15的位置，如果一路上升到23 
hole where 15 is supposed to be and if
you go all the way up to 23 you'll

274
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:16,140
注意，应该是一个洞或23，这就是您期望的系列
notice as a hole or 23 is supposed to be
and that's the series that you expect

275
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,910
对于简单的三次方，您只需在此散射图上查看
for simple cubic so you can just look at
this at this scattering pattern for a

276
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,870
钛酸钡，知道钛酸钡是简单的立方晶格
barium titanate and know that barium
titanate is a simple cubic lattice okay

277
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:27,330
这样就可以了
that's how it works pretty cool all
right

278
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:31,530
顺便说一句，钛酸钡是一种非常重要的光电材料
incidentally barium titanate is a fairly
important material for the opto

279
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:35,790
电子行业，它用于各种各样的事情，现在有更多
electronics industry it's used for
various things now there's more

280
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:41,220
信息中有更多分散的信息
information in this there is there's
more information in this scattering

281
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,810
到目前为止，我们所使用的模式只是散射角度
pattern than we've used so far all we've
used is the angles of scattering we

282
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:48,420
没有使用任何有关散射强度的东西， 
haven't used anything about the
intensity of scattering and there's a

283
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,260
我们可以利用的大量散射强度信息
lot of information in the intensity of
scattering that we can make use of

284
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:58,230
所以让我们来看看是否可以理解我们应该得到多少散射
so let's um see if we can understand
what how much scattering we should get

285
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,050
来自Miller指数HKL首先，香港存在结构因子s 
from Miller indices HKL well first of
all there's the structure factor s at HK

286
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:11,040
现在平方的L还可以写出来，所以结构
L which gets squared now all right let's
even write it out so the structure

287
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,460
记住这个s等于s乘以s的基数
factor remember this s equals s lattice
times s basis

288
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:23,860
乘以s的基础和s的格子，无非是强制选择规则
times s basis and s lattice does nothing
more than enforced selection rules

289
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:33,610
强制执行选择规则，这样我们就可以做到
enforce selection rules so we've done
that so that's not going to be

290
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,650
对我们的基础很有趣，因为在这个基础上只有一个原子
interesting for us s basis well there's
only one atom in this basis because it's

291
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,270
只是一种类型的原子一个单一的单个原子，因为它只是纯FCC 
just one type of atom a single single
atom on the basis it's just a pure FCC

292
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,800
没有培根的格子没有有趣的基础，所以您得到的只是表格
lattice with no bacon no interesting
basis so all you get is the the form

293
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,320
铝的系数，而铝衰变的形状因数
factor for aluminum and this form factor
for aluminum decays decays with

294
00:23:53,320 --> 00:24:01,330
随着我们上次提到的G的增加或增加而增加
increasing with increasing increasing G
as we mentioned last time or increasing

295
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:10,720
角度或增加的θ增加，所以我们期望总散射为
angle or increased increase theta so we
expect that the total scattering is

296
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,430
会随着散射角的增加而缓慢下降，但是有
going to drop slowly as a function of
increased scattering angle but there's

297
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,900
实际上，这并不是所有导致强度增加的因素，还有另外两个
actually that's not all that contributes
to the the intensity there's two other

298
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,820
首先影响强度的因素是概率
factors which contribute to the
intensity at first is the probability

299
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:33,550
对齐的可能性，所以这是微晶将
probability of alignment so this is the
probability that a crystallite will

300
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,390
以正确的方式对齐以获取散射，我们将回到
align in just the right way in order to
get scattering we'll come back to that

301
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:43,330
一会儿，最后一个因素被称为洛伦兹因子洛伦兹或
in a moment and the last factor is known
as the Lorentz factor Lorentz or

302
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:52,690
有时洛伦兹极化因子是
sometimes the Lorentz polarization
factor the polarization factor which is

303
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,930
确实是一个几何因素，我们对此不多说，但我会
really a geometric factor we're not
going to say too much about it but I'll

304
00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:00,280
向您展示它的外观，因此该函数是X随其变化的函数
show you what it looks like so this
function is a function which X it varies

305
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:04,630
作为角度的函数相当快，但随后在中间的任何地方
fairly rapidly as a function of angle
but then anywhere near at intermediate

306
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,950
角度大约在60到140之间比较平坦，然后又回升
angles it's fairly flat between around
60 and 140 and then it goes back up

307
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,080
最终在140左右开始回升，这是洛伦兹极化
eventually at around 140 it starts going
back up it's the Lorentz polarization

308
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,280
因素，这实际上是您如何设置实验的功能，因此，如果您
factor it's really a feature of how you
set up your experiment and so if you're

309
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,490
实验师，您会提前知道这个因素是什么
an experimentalist you will know what
this factor is in advance before you do

310
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:28,000
进行任何测量之前，现在有一个
any sort of before you do any sort of
measurement now there's a there's our

311
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,789
而不是这里有时是什么时候
instead of a
which here which is that sometimes when

312
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:33,669
人们会像这样向您展示X射线图
people present you with x-ray patterns
like this one

313
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,139
他们已经在这里除以洛伦兹极化系数， 
they'll have already divided by the
Lorentz polarization factor here and

314
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:41,619
其他时候他们将不会除以洛伦兹极化系数，因此
other times they will not have divided
by the Lorentz polarization factor so

315
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,099
真的，如果有人向您显示这样的数据，您应该问的是原始数据或
really if someone shows you data like
this you should ask is that raw data or

316
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,139
你已经用这个洛伦兹极化因子除了吗？ 
have you divided out by this Lorentz
polarization factor already and

317
00:25:49,139 --> 00:25:53,109
在许多考试中足够令人尴尬的是，他们会问你一个问题，他们
embarrassingly enough on many exams
they'll ask you a question and they

318
00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:55,899
不会告诉你他们是否被这个除法了
won't tell you whether they've divided
by this or not

319
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:59,619
因此，如果您想安全起见，应该说您应该告诉我您是否
so if you want to be safe you should say
you should have told me whether you're

320
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:05,019
除以这个因素，我无论如何都假设是这样
divided by this factor or not I'm
assuming whatever so anyway so that's

321
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:09,970
这就是这个因素，对于大多数角度也是如此，所以在这里我们只是分散
that's this factor and it also for most
angles so here we're only scattering up

322
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:15,970
到这里大约120度，所以这个因素在这里衰减为
to about 120 degrees here so this so
this factor here is decaying as a

323
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,019
高达120度的角度的函数，此因子在这里也随着
function of angle up to 120 degrees this
factor here is also decaying as a

324
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:23,349
角度的函数，所以我们天真地猜测我们应该始终
function of angle so we'd sort of
naively guess that we should always

325
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:26,679
随着角度的增加和/或多或少地衰减作为角度的函数
decay as a function of angle as you
increase the angle and and more or less

326
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,700
散射幅度随着角度的变化而衰减，但是我们还没有
the scattering amplitude is decaying as
a function of angle but we haven't

327
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,479
在这里看了这块，我们对齐的可能性很好
looked at this piece here our
probability of alignment well you might

328
00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:38,049
想想自己，您知道所有的微晶都是完全对齐的
think to yourself you know all the
crystallites are aligned completely

329
00:26:38,049 --> 00:26:42,249
随机，因此该因子应该是微不足道的，它应该只是1，但是认为
randomly so that that factor should be
trivial it should be just be 1 but think

330
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:46,989
一秒钟的时间，您会记得当我们谈论晶格族时
about this for a second you'll remember
when we talked about families of lattice

331
00:26:46,989 --> 00:26:50,710
平面，如果我们正在考虑与
planes if we're thinking about a lattice
plane spacing which is associated with

332
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:55,450
 1：1一族的晶格平面本来可以是一对一的家族
the 1:1 one family of lattice planes it
could have been the one one one family

333
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,799
晶格平面或1 1 bar 1或1 bar 1 1或1 bar 1 bar 1 I 
of lattice planes or the 1 1 bar 1 or
the 1 bar 1 1 or the 1 bar 1 bar 1 I

334
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,649
意味着有八种可能性都可以让您完全一样
mean there's eight possibilities which
would all give you exactly the same

335
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:09,519
您可以分散的晶格平面间距
lattice plane spacing that you can
scatter off of so in fact this

336
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:20,379
对齐的可能性实际上是HKL的倍数，所以如果我们回到
probability of alignment is actually the
multiplicity of HKL so if we go back to

337
00:27:20,379 --> 00:27:26,679
如果您要在此表格中查看您将多重性添加到此表格的位置
this table here to see where ya add the
multiplicities on to this table if we're

338
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:31,779
考虑1 0 0 M Miller指数有六个可能的方向
thinking about the 1 0 0 M Miller
indices there's six possible directions

339
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:35,320
这将呈现与1 0 0相同的晶格平面间距，有6 
which would present the same lattice
plane spacing as 1 0 0 there's 6

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,149
立方体的可能轴，但如果我们看1 1 0，将有12 
possible axes of the cube but if we're
looking at the 1 1 0 there would be 12

341
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:45,070
可以选择十二种不同的面孔方式
different faces Speight
for twelve different face ways you could

342
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:49,180
面对立方体，您将呈现相同的晶格平面间距，并且有人
face the cube that you would present the
same lattice plane spacing and someone

343
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,170
因为意识到三对一的心理多样性而赢得了巧克力奖
won a chocolate bar for realizing that
three to one has a mental multiplicity

344
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,450
 48之所以这些是我们要跟踪的因素
of 48 so these are the factors that we
want to keep track of if we want to

345
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:05,710
现在了解散射的强度，让我们看一下
understand the intensity of the
scattering now let's look at this let's

346
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:08,530
看两个实际上彼此接近一个角度的峰
look at two peaks that are actually
fairly close to each other an angle why

347
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,140
我是不是想看看彼此非常接近的两件事
am I do I want to look at two things
that are fairly close to each other an

348
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:18,640
如果F和L都随着速度的变化而缓慢衰减
angle well if you both F and L are
decaying kind of slowly as a function of

349
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,100
角度，所以如果我们在中间某个角度拍摄角度，就知道在这里
angle so you know here if we're take if
we take angles somewhere in the middle

350
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,870
你知道在100120左右，那么这个东西很平
you know around 100 120 then then this
thing is pretty flat this thing is

351
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:32,740
衰减缓慢，我们只能担心多重性，所以让我们
decaying only slowly and we can only
worry about the multiplicity so let's

352
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,950
在这里取得这两个峰3 1 1＆2 2 2 3 1 1＆2 2 2那里他们知道
take these two peaks here 3 1 1 & 2 2 2
3 1 1 & 2 2 2 there they you know they

353
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:42,850
里面有这些F sandeul，但是F和L几乎一样，因为我们
have these F sandeul's in them but F and
L are pretty much the same because we're

354
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:46,870
大约以相同的角度散射4 3 1 1＆2 2 2 
scattering at about the same angle 4 3 1
1 & 2 2 2 just a slight difference in

355
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:53,500
角度，但是多重性让我们回到这里的多重性3 1 1 
the angle but the multiplicities let's
back up to the multiplicities here 3 1 1

356
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,290
在哪里3 1 1在哪里有24在哪里-2在哪里有
has where is it 3 1 1 has a multiplicity
of 24 where to - 2 has a multiplicity of

357
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,970
 8，所以我们猜想3 1 1的峰值应该是峰值的3倍
8 so we would guess that the peak for 3
1 1 should be 3 times higher than the

358
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,850
 8的峰值，实际上3 1 1的峰值比3的峰值高近3倍
peak for 8 and indeed the peak for 3 1 1
is pretty close to 3 times higher than

359
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:15,400
 2 2 2的峰值就可以了，这就是多重​​性在游戏中获得的方式
the peak for 2 2 2 okay so that's how
the multiplicities get in in the game as

360
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,310
很好，所以这些散射强度实际上可能非常有用
well okay so these intensities of
scattering can actually be very useful

361
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:26,050
还要分析数据，我将向您展示一些人为的例子
for analyzing data as well I'm going to
show you a sort of artificial example of

362
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:34,180
可能有用的地方，所以这里有一些非常糟糕的铁数据
where this might be useful so here is
some fairly bad data for taken on iron

363
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,900
不好的原因有两个，第一个原因是因为山峰
that was bad for a couple reasons
the first reason is because the peaks

364
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,740
第二个原因是因为您只看到三个峰值
are pretty broad the second reason is
because you only see three peaks with

365
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,160
三个峰值很难说出您在谈论哪个系列
three peaks it's pretty hard to tell
which series you're talking about here

366
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,430
您无法数到第七个，看看是否缺少第七个，因为
you can't count out to the seventh and
see if the seventh is missing because

367
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,850
您只有三个峰，这将有些困难，但是
you only have three peaks so this is
going to be a little bit difficult but

368
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,810
我们有散射的幅度，实际上可能是
we have the amplitudes of the scattering
and that actually might be might

369
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,160
会有所帮助，所以我们将看看是否可以利用这一点，因此我们将
be helpful so we'll see if we can we can
make use of that so we go through the

370
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,080
测量角度的相同练习计算晶格平面
same exercise of measuring the the
angles calculate the lattice plane

371
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,030
间距取第一晶格平面间距与各种
spacing take the ratio of the first
lattice plane spacing to the various

372
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:15,280
晶格平面间距da两点零三平方1.4平方是2是
lattice plane spacing da two point zero
three squared over 1.4 squared is two is

373
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,300
到两点O 3平方超过一分之一七平方约3我们
to two point O 3 squared over one point
one seven squared is about three we

374
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,030
意识到那些是一二和三的整数比，所以那些可能是
realize those are in the integer ratios
of one two and three so those could be

375
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:28,510
两种可能性，要么是简单的三次方，然后是这些
two possibilities either
it's simple cubic and then these

376
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:34,120
散射峰对应于1 0 0 1 1 0和1 1 1，表示此整数n H 
scattering Peaks correspond to 1 0 0 1 1
0 and 1 1 1 meaning this integer n H

377
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,840
平方加K平方加l平方是1 2或3，也可能是n是2 4＆6 
squared plus K squared plus l squared is
1 2 or 3 or it could be n is 2 4 & 6

378
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,890
那些仍然是1 2＆3的比例，但是它们对应于米勒
those would still be in the ratio of 1 2
& 3 but they would correspond to Miller

379
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:50,890
 1 1 0 2 0 0＆2 1 1的索引我将加平方并加起来得到
indices of 1 1 0 2 0 0 & 2 1 1 which I'm
going to add squared and add it up give

380
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:55,650
您2 4＆6，所以我们仅通过查看这些数据就不知道是哪一个
you 2 4 & 6 so we don't know which one
it is just by looking at the this data

381
00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,460
所以我们要做好什么，我们可以采取几种方法
so what do we do well there's a couple
of approaches we could take one approach

382
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:09,340
是我们可以尝试计算晶格常数a，因此，如果我们计算
is that we could try calculating the the
lattice constant a so if we calculate

383
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:13,390
可以假设简单的三次方计算晶格常数， 
the lattice we could assume simple cubic
calculate the lattice constant and we

384
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:16,630
将得到D乘以平方的平方根再加上K平方再加上l平方
would get D times square root of a
square plus K squared plus l squared

385
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:21,340
给我们2.0 3埃，我们对BCC做同样的事情，我们得到的是
gives us 2.0 3 angstroms we did the same
thing for BCC we'd get something that's

386
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:24,610
 2的平方根更大，因为我们将所有末端乘以2，所以这
square root of 2 bigger because we're
multiplying all the ends by 2 so this

387
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:28,930
平方根里面的东西乘以2，所以不是
thing inside the square root is
multiplied by 2 overall so instead of

388
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:32,020
指向零点三，我们得到两个点八六好，所以我们有一个
getting to point zero three we get two
point eight six okay so we have a

389
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:38,290
不同的晶格平面和常规晶胞的尺寸不同
different lattice plane a different size
of the of the unit cell and conventional

390
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:43,030
现在，对于BCC案例的晶胞，为什么对我们有帮助，因为我们不知道什么
unit cell for a BCC case now why does
that help us because we don't know what

391
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:47,050
晶格常数适用于铁，但确实可以帮助我们，因为我们可以尝试
the lattice constant is for iron but it
does help us because we could try

392
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:52,930
计算简单立方情况下的原子密度，我们将有一个原子
calculating the atomic density for the
simple cubic case we would have one atom

393
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:58,240
每两点O 3埃的立方，而对于BCC，则是两个原子两个
per two point O 3 angstroms cubed
whereas for a BCC it's two atoms two

394
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,130
常规晶胞中每两点八六埃立方的原子和
atoms in the conventional unit cell per
two point eight six angstroms cubes and

395
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,760
这些密度彼此之间的平方根为二，所以如果
those densities differ from each other
by a factor of square root of two so if

396
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,309
我们知道铁的原子密度
we knew the atomic density of iron we
could

397
00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:12,879
是的，所以我们会完成的，但是假设我们不会碰巧知道
which one it is so we'd be done but
suppose we don't happen to know the

398
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:16,690
铁的原子密度，那么我们该怎么办好吧，还有其他事情
atomic density of iron so what do we do
then okay there are other other things

399
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:21,909
我们可以调用，我们可以看一下散射幅度
we could invoke we could look at the
scattering amplitudes which was what I

400
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:26,470
一直领先到现在，所以以这个散射角度
was leading up to now remember so at
this at this scattering angle the

401
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:30,759
洛伦兹系数不断减小，形状因数总是随着
Lorentz factor is decreasing the form
factor is always decreasing as a

402
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:34,749
增加角度的功能，因此您会天真地希望a应该是
function of increased angle so you would
sort of naively expect that a should be

403
00:32:34,749 --> 00:32:39,340
大于B应该大于C但不是C大于唯一
bigger than B should be bigger than C
but it's not C is bigger the only thing

404
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,320
这可能解释了如果峰值C的多重性更大
that could possibly explain that is if
the multiplicity of the peak C is bigger

405
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,340
而不是B的多重性，所以如果看简单三次
than the multiplicity of B so if you
look at the simple cubic the simple

406
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,389
三次，我们确定第一个峰是1 0 0，第二个峰是1 1 0，第三个峰
cubic we identify the first peak is 1 0
0 the second peak is 1 1 0 and the third

407
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,950
峰值为1 1 1 B的多重性大于C的多重性
peak as 1 1 1 the multiplicity of B is
bigger than the multiplicity of C so

408
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,789
没有理由让C峰大于B峰
there's no reason you would ever get the
C peak to be bigger than B peak

409
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:06,009
但是对于BCC，C峰到1 1的多重性是24个单词
however for BCC the multiplicity of the
C peak to 1 1 is 24 words a multiplicity

410
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:12,009
 B峰的峰值是2 0 0，所以如果您现在C实际上应该比B大
of the B peak is 2 0 0 so C should
actually be bigger than B now if you

411
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:15,490
只是看一下多重性，您期望C应该是4的倍数
just look at the multiplicities you
would expect a factor of 4 that C should

412
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,090
比B大4倍，不比B大4倍，只有大约2倍
be 4 times bigger than B and it's not 4
times bigger than B it's only about two

413
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:24,519
可能比B大两倍大一点，但它不是完整的原因
maybe two and a bit bigger times bigger
than B but the reason it's not a full

414
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,119
大四倍是因为F在下降，形状因数在下降， 
four times bigger is because F is
dropping the form factor is dropping and

415
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,080
洛伦兹系数也在同时下降，因此与此竞争
Lorentz factor is dropping also at the
same time so it's competing with this

416
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,220
降低这两个条件的影响，但只要考虑一下
decreasing effect from these other two
terms but any rates just by looking at

417
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,889
我们可以从振幅中得知，这一定是BC C 
this data we can we can tell just from
the amplitudes that this must be BC C of

418
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:46,450
当然我们也知道铁不是简单的立方，因为只有一个
course we also know that iron is not
simple cubic because there's only one

419
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,389
具有简单立方晶格的元素，即po和铁
element that takes a simple cubic
lattice and that's polonium and iron

420
00:33:49,389 --> 00:33:53,619
不是po，所以它也是一种欺骗的方式
isn't polonium and so that does it also
it's sort of a cheating way to go about

421
00:33:53,619 --> 00:34:01,720
好的，让我们再做一个例子这是中子的例子
it all right so let's do one more
example this is the example of neutron

422
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,519
散射中子散射与X射线散射非常相似，但它是
scattering neutron scattering is very
similar to x-ray scattering but it's a

423
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,300
稍微简单一点，因为形状因子只是一个常数，只是核子
little simpler because the form factor
is just a constant it's just the nuclear

424
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:19,659
散射长度不是G的函数，所以我的天哪是格子类型
scattering length it's not a function of
G so what's the lattice type oh my gosh

425
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:27,789
哦，是的，我在这个问题上不太好，所以是的，所以你可以说这是FC 
oh yes yes I'm not so good at this um so
yes so it's so you can tell it's it's FC

426
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:32,500
这是FCC，由于模式不做任何计算
this is FCC without doing any
calculation because of the pattern the

427
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,429
您可以想象一下，如果这是3这是4那么有一个很大的
you can sort of imagine that's if this
is 3 this is 4 then there's a big

428
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:42,639
到8的间距然后到11的一点间距12靠近在一起，所以您可以看到
spacing to 8 then a little spacing to 11
12 close together so you can kind of see

429
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,879
间距是FCC晶格的正确间距，所以如果您
that the spacing is the right spacing
for an FCC lattice okay so but if you

430
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,510
想要贯穿整个故事我们可以经历整个故事
want to go through the whole the whole
the whole story we can go through the

431
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:56,799
整个故事仔细测量角度，计算晶格平面间距
whole story carefully measure the angles
calculate the lattice plane spacings

432
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:02,530
在晶格平面间距的平方上取1对1的比率
take the ratios of a 1 over the 1 over
the square of the lattice plane spacings

433
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:07,630
你得到一个1.3 2.6我们意识到将这些乘以3我们意识到这些
you get one 1.3 2.6 we realize
multiplies these by 3 we realize these

434
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:13,030
是整数比率3 4非常接近8非常接近11实际数据
are integer ratios 3 4 pretty close to 8
pretty close to 11 actually the data

435
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:17,109
并不是很好，如果备份得好，您会意识到这些峰是
isn't so great and if you back up
well you'll realize that these Peaks are

436
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:21,849
相当广泛，他们不是很准确地知道解决方案不是
pretty broad they're not really that
accurately you know resolved it's not

437
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:26,230
最好的数据是1959年采集的数据
the greatest data this was data taken in
1959 I mean modern modern data is much

438
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:31,180
更好，但是好吧，您可以肯定地看到它将会
better but but ok it's you can
definitely see that it's it's going to

439
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:39,039
成为FCC，您还可以标记米勒指数并获得
be FCC and you can also label the Miller
indices and get an estimate of the

440
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:42,789
晶格常数好吧，所以晶格常数，也许你不知道
lattice constant okay so the lattice
constant and maybe you don't know it

441
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:46,569
在百分之几之内，但是您对它的估计是相当不错的，但是
within a few percent but you have a
pretty good estimate of what it is but

442
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:50,680
事实上，我们在这里拥有的东西，我们可以写出我们可以
in fact what we have here and we can
write out the multiplicities we can

443
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,430
标记峰以及通过执行此操作实际上会注意到您会注意到
label the peaks as well actually notice
that you by doing this you'll notice

444
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:59,260
您可能已经预测到会有一个轻微的峰，这里的峰为4至0峰
that there's you would have predicted a
slight peak here a peak a 4 to 0 peak

445
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,839
这里没有肩膀
here where the shoulder is it's not
there

446
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,289
我的意思是您，但是如果您仔细地看一下，您会发现其中有些
I mean you but if you kind of look at it
carefully you see that there's kind of a

447
00:36:05,289 --> 00:36:09,700
肩膀虚弱，您可以想象这只是一个很小的峰
weak shoulder you can sort of imagine
that it's just a very small peak that's

448
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:15,220
现在坐在那里，这样可以告诉我们高峰在哪里，但是我们
sitting there now so this tells us
whether where the peaks are but we

449
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,430
我们想获得更多信息，我们想知道什么
there's more information that we would
like to get we would like to know what

450
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:25,299
基础是，所以我们知道碳化钛碳化钛是FCC，它
the basis is so we know that titanium
carbide titanium carbide is FCC and it

451
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:31,690
必须有一个基础，我们有两个基础，两个基础
has to have a basis we the basis it has
two elements in it with the basis of two

452
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:37,540
两个原子的原子，我们想知道什么是形式
atoms of two atoms
and we'd like to know what is the form

453
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,660
换句话说，您将钛放在哪里
of the basis in other words where do you
put the titanium where you put the

454
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,790
晶胞中的碳，所以我们可以算出好吧，所以我们可以任意
carbon in the unit cell so can we figure
that out well okay so arbitrarily we can

455
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:51,400
我们总是可以将钛分配到零零零零的位置
we can always assign titanium to the
position at position zero zero zero in

456
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,850
单位晶格我们将钛位置定义为零零零
the unit cell we'll just define the
titanium position to be zero zero zero

457
00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:02,020
但是然后碳将置于uvw位置，我们偶然不知道
but then carbon will put at position uvw
which we don't know incidentally I

458
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,619
应该提到碳化钛实际上是一种非常重要的材料
should have mentioned titanium carbide
is actually a really important material

459
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:08,859
有谁知道这是另一个有谁知道为什么碳化钛是
does anyone know here's another one
anyone know why titanium carbide is

460
00:37:08,859 --> 00:37:15,400
真的很重要，将它用于需要的任何事情
really important use it for what yeah
yeah anything that needs to be really

461
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,830
很难，那么是的，所以今天任何碳化物都是最难的一种
hard yeah then yeah okay so and so today
any carbide is one of the hardest

462
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,680
那里没有钻石的材料，我认为只有一两个
materials out there short of diamond I
think there's only one or two others

463
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,480
和碳化钛一样坚硬，很容易看到
that are as hard as titanium carbide
it's easy to see it's easier to make

464
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,530
碳化钛，它不比钻石贵，所以无论何时需要
titanium carbide it's not as expensive a
diamond it's so whenever you need

465
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:36,100
任何需要非常艰苦的事情，它经常用于事物
anything that needs to be very tough
it's very frequently used for things

466
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,790
如工具，如果您需要锯或钻头将要切穿的东西
like tools if you need a saw or a drill
bit that's gonna cut through something

467
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:43,780
很难，经常是碳化钛，所以这就是为什么
very hard it's very frequently titanium
carbide so that's why they did this

468
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,280
可以追溯到1959年，因为它是一种有趣的材料
experiment way back in in 1959 because
it was an interesting material even back

469
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:56,500
在1959年，他们甚至都不知道它的结构，所以我认为视频也许
in 1959 and they didn't even know its
structure so okay so I think video maybe

470
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,750
他们不知道其他东西的结构，我不确定，但是
they didn't know the structure from
something else I don't I'm not sure but

471
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,240
我认为他们不知道，所以无论如何我们都不知道碳在哪里
I don't think they knew it so anyway we
don't know where the carbon is in the

472
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,619
单位细胞，所以我们要看看是否可以使用这些峰中的强度数据
unit cells so we're gonna see if we can
use this intensity data from these Peaks

473
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:14,470
弄清楚在单元格中什么地方通常是我们要去的部分
to figure out where in the unit cell it
is so generally the piece we're going to

474
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:19,540
感兴趣的是最终变得越来越重要的基本结构因素
be interested in is the basic structure
factor which is which ends up getting

475
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:26,740
平方，那很好，也许我会在这里首先写出等于
squared and that is well maybe I'll
write this out here first s basis equals

476
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:36,369
单位单元e中单位单元中的alpha与IG点的总和R alpha乘以B 
sum over alpha in the unit cell in unit
cell e to the I G dot R alpha times B

477
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:42,040
晶胞中有两个原子的alpha，因此此处的s平方为B 
alpha for there's two atoms in the unit
cell so s basis squared here will be B

478
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,410
钛加B碳e会写成
titanium plus B carbon e to that will
write it as

479
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:56,619
 2pi HKL点缀在uvw中，然后将其取平方
the 2pi HKL dotted into uvw and then you
take that thing you square it and that

480
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:02,650
如果您知道这些核素是什么，现在将为您提供基础结构因子
will give you the basis structure factor
now if you knew what these nuclear

481
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,339
散射长度是钛，B是碳，您可能会打架
scattering lengths were be titanium and
B be carbon you might have a fighting

482
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:11,170
找出紫外线和紫外线的机会，但假设我们不知道可以
chance of figuring out what UV and W
were but suppose we didn't know that can

483
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:14,950
我们仍然可以取得任何进展，如果我愿意，我们可以取得一些进展
we still make any progress well we can
make a little bit of progress if I give

484
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,510
你的提示，这是你得到的一种提示
you a hint
this is a kind of hint you get on an

485
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:25,020
考试考试的提示是FCC具有两个原子基础和一个
exam the kind of hint you get on an exam
is that FCC with two atom basis and a

486
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:38,559
在此基础上，只有两个共同点
basis there's only two common ones only
two common ones common possibilities in

487
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,760
事实上，我什至不知道不是这两种情况之一的任何情况
fact I don't even know of any cases that
are not one of these two there may be

488
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,609
即使是一个定理，你也不能拥有其他任何东西，我不确定
even a theorem that you can't have
anything else I'm not sure about that so

489
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:48,880
不要引用我，但无论如何，我们都已经看到了这两种可能性
don't quote me but anyway the two
possibilities we both we've seen them

490
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,319
两者之前都存在所谓的锌混合结构
both before there's the so-called zinc
blende structure which is the same as

491
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:59,109
我们在课堂上讨论过的砷化镓结构将UVW置于
the gallium arsenide structure which we
talked about in class which puts UVW at

492
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:05,650
一季度，一季度，一季度，另一种可能性
the position one quarter one quarter one
quarter and the other possibility we

493
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:16,529
还讨论了UVW为1/2 1/2 1/2的氯化钠结构
also discussed is the sodium chloride
structure which has UVW at 1/2 1/2 1/2

494
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:24,400
那么我们能找出这两种可能性中的哪一种很好吗，让我们
so can we figure out which one of these
two possibilities it is okay well let's

495
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:32,440
看看我们是否可以这样做，让我们先尝试一下，再尝试锌混合结构好吗
see if we can do it so let's try first
try one try zinc blende structure okay

496
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:42,970
因此，在这种情况下，基数平方等于B钛加B碳e 
so in this case s basis squared equals
well we have B titanium plus B Carbon e

497
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:51,089
到2 pi H KL，然后是1/4 1/4 1/4 
to the 2 pi H KL and then 1/4 1/4 1/4

498
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,620
我们也可以在这里写这个因子这个指数因子也是
which we can also write this factor here
this exponential factor here is also

499
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:05,510
等价于PI的e乘以I乘以H加k加L或I的两倍
equivalent to e to the PI over two times
I times h plus k plus L or equivalently

500
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:15,460
这就是我的h加k加L所以好吧，我不在这里了，我们在这里
this would be I to the h plus k plus L
so okay I'm out of room here we're here

501
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:28,070
所以我们有一个平方的基础等于钛加上碳乘以I到h 
so we have s basis squared equals be
titanium plus be carbon times I to the h

502
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:35,510
加K加l平方好吗，那是h KL的函数
plus K plus l squared okay and what is
that as a function of h KL well there's

503
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:41,060
三种可能的情况之一我的意思是，情况a是h加
three possibilities
case one I mean a case a is that h plus

504
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:48,620
 k加L是4的倍数，等于整数n的四倍，因此在这种情况下，我们
k plus L is a multiple of 4 equals four
times an integer n so in that case we

505
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:56,750
获得s的平方的平方等于钛加上碳的绝对值
get s basis squared equals be titanium
plus be carbon the absolute value

506
00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:02,470
平方第二种可能性情况B是
squared the second possibility case B is

507
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:09,080
 h加k加L仍然是偶数，但不是四的倍数，因此我们称
h plus k plus L is still even but it's
not a multiple of four so we'll call for

508
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:19,100
 n加2，在这种情况下，我们得到的s平方等于钛-碳
n plus two in which case we get s basis
squared equals be titanium - be carbon

509
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:32,330
在第三种情况下平方C是h加k加上L是奇奇在这种情况下S 
squared in the third case case C is h
plus k plus L is odd odd in which case S

510
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:42,170
基数平方是B钛正负I乘以B碳平方，即
basis squared is B titanium plus or
minus I times B Carbon squared which is

511
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,350
钛平方加B碳平方
be titanium squared plus B Carbon
squared

512
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:54,260
好吧，好吧，让我们凝视一下，您能做什么
good all right so we've let's stare at
that for a second and what can you

513
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:58,700
从这个井得出结论，无论B钛和B碳有多长
conclude from this well no matter what B
titanium and B carbon are as long as

514
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,960
他们是真实的，他们是三种可能性中最大的一种
they're real which they are the largest
of the three possibilities is always

515
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,519
无论哪种情况，如果它们是钛，都是碳
either case a and
case be if they be titanium be carbon

516
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,819
具有相同的符号，则如果a是三种可能性中的最大值，则
have the same sign then case a is the
largest of the three possibilities if

517
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:14,869
如果B是三种可能性中的最大值，则它们具有相反的符号，因此
they have opposite sign in case B is the
largest of three possibilities so the

518
00:43:14,869 --> 00:43:19,969
现在，让我们来看看最大的峰肯定是h加k加L 
largest Peaks should definitely have
even h plus k plus L now let's look at

519
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:29,329
这些数据，您将看到h加k加L，您会注意到最高峰
this data and you'll see h plus k plus L
and you'll notice that the highest peaks

520
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:36,319
总是系统地总是有奇数h加k加l所以总是一个
always have odd h plus k plus l
systematically always there so the one

521
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,559
一一高三一一高三三一高三三
one one is high three one one is high
three three one is high three three

522
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:43,700
三个很高，其他所有的都很小，所以这并不相同
three is high all the other ones are
small are even so this does not agree

523
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:49,749
与不同意的数据同意
with the data it does not agree agree

524
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:56,779
好吧，我们可以尝试其他方法，我们可以尝试氯化钠结构，所以尝试
well we can try something else we can
try the sodium chloride structure so try

525
00:43:56,779 --> 00:44:05,299
氯化钠在这种情况下我们很好我在这里某处写了它
sodium chloride in which case we have
well I wrote it over here somewhere

526
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:15,670
是的那边是1/2 1/2和1/2所以s的平方是B钛加上
yeah over there it's 1/2 1/2 and 1/2 so
s basis squared is then B titanium plus

527
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:26,900
 B碳乘以e到2 pi HK的碳现在乘以1/2 1/2 1/2，然后全部
B carbon times e to the 2 pi H K now
dotted into 1/2 1/2 1/2 and then all

528
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:37,190
平方，我们可以重写为B钛加B碳乘以负1/2 
squared and that we can rewrite as B
titanium plus B carbon times minus 1/2

529
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:44,359
 h加k加L都平方，所以有两种情况我们可以得到情况1 
the h plus k plus L all squared so
there's two cases we can have case 1

530
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:54,380
好的，所以a是h加k加上L是奇数，在这种情况下，我们有B钛-是
case ok so a is h plus k plus L is odd
in which case we have B titanium - be

531
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:04,160
碳平方是答案，而案例B案例B是h加k加l等于
carbon squared is the answer whereas
case B case B is h plus k plus l equals

532
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:15,040
即使在这种情况下，我们有B钛加B碳平方即可
even in which case we have B titanium
plus B Carbon squared ok

533
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,340
那么，现在最大的是什么？您可以看到，如果这个想法
so now what's which one is largest here
well you can see that if this idea maybe

534
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:26,020
碳具有相同的符号，则偶数将始终更大，而如果它们
carbon have the same sign then the even
will always be larger whereas if they

535
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:30,460
具有相反的符号，那么如果您查看数据，则奇数会更大
have the opposite sign then the odd will
have larger well if you look at the data

536
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:35,590
 h加k加L奇数显然要大得多，所以这告诉我们
the h plus k plus L odd is clearly much
larger and so that tells us this it's

537
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:42,780
与这种情况相一致，如果是钛，则钛具有相反的符号
consistent with this case that if be
titanium be titanium has opposite sign

538
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:52,780
 B碳的符号是什么，所以大的峰是B钛-被碳平方
what's its sign of B carbon so the large
Peaks are B titanium - be carbon squared

539
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:56,700
 B钛和B碳具有相反的符号，并且小峰是
with B titanium and B carbon having
opposite sign and the small Peaks are

540
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:02,830
两者之和也有相反的符号大家好
the sum of the two with them having an
opposite sign as well okay everyone

541
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:07,780
或多或少有点满意，是的，请说是，好吧，谢谢
happy with that more or less a little
bit yes please say yes all right thank

542
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:12,670
好的，让我们看看，是的， 
you all right
good so let's see so yeah there's the

543
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,280
摘要摘要幻灯片，所以我们得出结论它必须是氯化钠结构
summary summary slide so we conclude it
has to be sodium chloride structure

544
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:23,170
让我们来看一下，以便我们可以继续讨论哦在这里，让我们讨论一下您
let's see so we can actually go on and
discuss oh here let's discuss how you

545
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,510
产生中子一秒钟，所以我们讨论了您如何产生中子
make neutrons for a second so we
discussed how you make probably make s

546
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:34,000
我认为上一讲是最后一讲的最后一个托盘，但我们没有讨论
trays in the last in the last last
lecture I think but we haven't discussed

547
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,590
您如何制造中子这是一个中子设施散裂的中子源
how you make neutrons this is a neutron
facility a spallation neutron source

548
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:42,280
也就在同步加速源旁边的路上
also right down the road next to the
synchrotron source rather large and

549
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,020
昂贵的设备，但我们需要的是需要波长在
expensive apparatus but what we need is
we need neutrons with a wavelength on

550
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,940
一埃的量级如果波长为一，我们如何得到很好的结果
the order of one angstrom how do we get
that well if the wavelength is one

551
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:57,820
埃的动量是Lambda上的2 pi H bar，据此我们可以计算出
angstrom the momentum is 2 pi H bar over
lambda and from that we can calculate

552
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:06,070
我们需要的能量在2m上平方P等于大约8000万
that the energy we need is P squared
over 2m equals approximately 80 mil

553
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:10,930
电子伏特或约800开尔文，我们将适当的因素
electron volts or about 800 Kelvin we
put in the appropriate factor

554
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,200
玻尔兹曼常数使中间温度升高，这可能听起来对您来说
Boltzmann's constant to make an inter
temperature and this might sound to you

555
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:19,060
就像它很热，但实际上800开尔文对中子来说真的很冷，为什么
like it's hot but in fact 800 Kelvin is
really really cold for neutrons why is

556
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,160
那你如何首先获得中子
that well how do you get the neutrons in
the first place

557
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:31,030
制造中子使中子恢复到以前没有的状态
making neutrons making neutrons well
back in the old days they didn't have

558
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,680
中子，然后是第二次世界大战和原子弹
neutrons and then along came the the
Second World War and the atomic bomb

559
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:39,070
项目和原子弹项目之后，他们有核反应堆和
project and after the atomic bomb
project they had nuclear reactors and

560
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:45,430
核反应堆以中子为副产物，因此可能是副产物
nuclear reactors have neutrons as a
by-product so possibly one is byproduct

561
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:55,090
裂变，你可以想象，当一个中子从原子核的
of fission and you can imagine that when
a neutron comes off of a of a nucleus in

562
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,470
某些裂变过程产生了数百万个电子伏特
some fission process it's coming out
with millions of electron volts rather

563
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,550
比毫伏电子伏特高得多，所以它非常的有活力
than milla electron volts so it's
extremely extremely energetic so this

564
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:10,150
 800开尔文的能量非常低，还有一种更受欢迎的方法
800 Kelvin is extremely low energy
there's a more favorite method for

565
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:13,720
因为人们不喜欢在后院安装原子反应堆
making because people don't like to have
atomic reactors in their backyard these

566
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,160
如今，有一种更受青睐的制造中子的方法，实际上它更
days there's a more favored method for
making neutrons in fact it's more

567
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:23,410
高效的方法也被称为阿巴拉契亚（Appalachia），这就是
efficient method as well which is known
as Appalachia and that's what this

568
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:27,850
来源是这个中子来源是愿望来源愿望的概念
source is this Neutron source is
aspiration source the idea of aspiration

569
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:32,800
来源与X射线管的想法没有什么不同，在X射线管中您通常会
source is not unlike the idea of an
x-ray tube where you take usually a

570
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,820
质子和质子，您可以将其加速到大约千兆电子伏特
proton and proton and you accelerate it
to about a Giga electron volt and you

571
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:46,330
将其击中目标目标，其想法是粉碎一些核和一些核， 
hit it onto a target target and the idea
is to smash some nucleus some nuclei and

572
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:50,860
因为您以如此高的命中率击中中子，所以现在再次开始中子
kick off some neutrons now again since
you're hitting it with such a high a

573
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,680
高能量，您将用一些非常高的能量来启动中子
high energy you're going to kick off
neutrons with some very very high energy

574
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,660
同样，无论您使用哪种方法来产生中子
as well so whichever method you use to
create neutrons they're coming off with

575
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:05,290
令人难以置信的高能量，您必须将其冷却，以便使其冷却
an incredibly high energy and you have
to make them cold so to make them cold

576
00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:12,100
使用的是主持人，主持人基本上只是一个大坦克
what you use is you use a moderator and
a moderator is basically just a big tank

577
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:16,200
某些物质，中子可以进入该物质并在附近反弹
of some substance where the neutrons can
go in the substance and bounce around

578
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:21,630
将能量释放给物质，所以人们经常使用碳石墨
giving off their energy to the substance
so frequently people use carbon graphite

579
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:27,610
石墨是碳石墨碳水重水许多材料什么
graphite is carbon graphite carbon water
heavy water lots of materials anything

580
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,750
中子可以撞击并释放能量给
that will that the neutrons can bump
into and give off their energy to and

581
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,530
最终在这件事的另一端，你得到了中子， 
eventually out the other end of this
thing you get you get neutrons and you

582
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,390
想把它们拉下来，直到我知道
want to
pull them down until they I have about

583
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:43,660
一旦有中子出来，现在就价值800开尔文的能量
800 Kelvin worth of energy now once you
have the the neutrons coming out you

584
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:50,190
需要以某种方式弄清楚如何使它们单色八
need to somehow figure out how to make
them monochromatic monochrome eight

585
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:54,369
意味着您只想获得一个波长传闻，这是第一个规则
meaning you just want to get one
wavelength rumor that is the first rule

586
00:49:54,369 --> 00:49:59,619
没有您的波长，所以您必须要单色八倍，所以您如何
no your wavelength so you have to
monochrome eight so how do you

587
00:49:59,619 --> 00:50:05,529
单色八种方法之一是衍射，因此可以使用晶体
monochrome eight one way method one is
to diffract so you can use a crystal

588
00:50:05,529 --> 00:50:09,249
众所周知，我们在x射线以及来自
that's known we mentioned this in the
case of x-rays as well diffract from a

589
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:18,220
已知晶体中的已知晶体，有时可以起作用，但是还有另一个
known crystal from known crystal and
that sometimes works but there's another

590
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:21,849
也使用的方法对中子非常好
method which is also used which is very
nice for neutrons which is a

591
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:29,259
飞行时间方法飞行时间以下列方式工作
time-of-flight method time-of-flight
which works in the following way

592
00:50:29,259 --> 00:50:33,400
所以你有一束中子进入这里，然后你会有一个
so you have a beam of neutrons coming in
over here and then you have sort of a

593
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,690
您可以打开和关闭的窗口打开并关闭您想要的任何东西，然后您
window which you can open and close open
and close whatever you want and then you

594
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:43,059
从这里到这里有一个长距离的el，另一个可以打开的窗口
have a long spacing el from here to here
and another window which you can open

595
00:50:43,059 --> 00:50:46,900
然后关闭，所以您可以快速打开和关闭窗口
and close so you open up and close the
window very quickly to let in a little

596
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,670
脉冲中子，然后在某个时间点T后再打开另一个
pulse of neutrons and then at some time
delta T later you open up the other

597
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,710
窗口，所以您知道L，您知道T，所以如果它是从第一个窗口到
window so then you know L you know T so
if it made it from the first window to

598
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:02,380
 ΔT中的第二个窗口你知道它的速度，所以L除以ΔT是
the second window in delta T you know
its velocity so L divided by delta T is

599
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,099
如果知道它的速度，就知道它的动量。 
its velocity if you know its velocity
you know its momentum if you know its

600
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:10,869
动量，您知道它的波长，所以您可以通过给它一个
momentum you know its wavelength so you
can select by knowing how by giving it a

601
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:13,869
从第一个窗口到第二个窗口需要一定的时间
certain amount of time to get from the
first window to the second window you

602
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:17,739
可以为那里的特定速度选择特定的速度
can select for a particular velocity
there for a particular momentum there

603
00:51:17,739 --> 00:51:22,749
对于特定的波长，我还要提及的一件事是
for a particular wavelength one more
thing that I do want to mention about

604
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,900
在接下来的中子中，中子只会说一两件事
neutrons will say maybe just one or two
more things about them in the next

605
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:29,440
讲座，但我现在想提一提，这是人们喜欢中子的原因之一
lecture but I do want to mention now is
one of the reasons people like neutrons

606
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:35,980
是中子实际上有一个自旋，它使您能够看到具有
is the neutrons actually have a spin and
that enables you to see things that have

607
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,150
如果在一个区域中有更多旋转，则旋转很重要的重要性
importance where the spin is important
if you have more spins in one region

608
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,989
而不是另一个区域，中子对它们感到
than another region the neutrons are
sensitive to that they feel the the

609
00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:48,730
作为光子不存在的潜力的局部磁环境
local magnetic environment as a
potential where as photons do not they

610
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,759
不在乎中子在当地的磁场环境，因为
don't care about the local
magnetic environment neutrons do because

611
00:51:51,759 --> 00:51:55,569
中子有一些自旋，我们会停在那儿，然后我们将完成
the neutrons have some spin okay we'll
stop there and we'll pick up finish this

612
00:51:55,569 --> 00:52:04,320
下一场下一场演讲[掌声]
