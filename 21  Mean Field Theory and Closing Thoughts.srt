1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,350
欢迎大家回来，这是聚和态物理的二十一讲
welcome back everyone this is the
twenty-first lecture of the condensed

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,189
当我们上次离开时​​，我们谈论的是
matter course when we left off last time
we were talking about magnetism in

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:15,450
特别是我们在谈论铁磁性
particular we were talking about Ferro
magnetism Ferro magnetism and everything

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,199
我们所说的关于磁性的重点实际上是理解
that we said about magnetism was really
focused on understanding what happens at

5
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,970
零温度所有时刻彼此对齐，但通常
zero temperature all of the moments
aligning with each other but generally

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,490
您可以问一个问题，当您抬高铁磁磁铁时会发生什么
you can ask the question what happens to
a Ferro magnet as you raise the

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,539
温度，我们对费罗发生的事情有一些直觉
temperature and we have a little bit of
an intuition about what happens in Ferro

8
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:38,040
有限T的磁性将是您今天的大部分演讲的主题
magnetism at finite T which will be the
subject of much of today's lecture you

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,030
知道在零温度下所有时刻都对齐，但是当您打开
know at zero temperature all the moments
align but then when you turn on the

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,809
温度会有一些热波动和瞬间
temperature there's going to be some
thermal fluctuations and the moments

11
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:49,260
将不再完全对齐，在某些时候我们可能没有费罗
won't be completely aligned anymore and
at some point we might not have Ferro

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,190
磁性，所以总的来说，我们想知道的是
magnetism at all so in general what we
want to know is we'd like to know as a

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,940
温度的函数什么是磁化强度
function of temperature what is the
magnetization some sort of equation of

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,980
状态，也许我们也将允许外部施加磁场
state and maybe we'll also allow for an
externally applied magnetic field so

15
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,119
这就是我们有兴趣发现的内容，我应该先介绍一下
this is what we're interested in finding
out now I should start with a bit of a

16
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,070
请注意，在上一讲中，我们花了很多时间思考
caveat in the last lecture we spent a
lot of time thinking about the idea of

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,049
由于长距离偶极相互作用而产生的磁畴和
magnetic domains which are created due
to long-range dipolar interactions and

18
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,130
即使本地物理学是要对齐铁磁磁体中的所有矩
even though the local physics is to
align all the moments in a Ferro magnet

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,280
在低温下会有一些全球物理学
at low temperature there will be some
global physics which will make some

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,549
区域朝上，某些区域朝下，以最小化全局磁场
regions point up in some regions point
down to minimize the global magnetic

21
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,850
能量，所以我们今天不打算考虑那种物理学
energy so we're not going to think about
that kind of physics today we're only

22
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,439
会局部地思考，所以对我们来说，零温度的铁磁体会
going to think sort of locally so for us
a Ferro magnet at zero temperature would

23
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:38,460
至少为了今天的目的使他们的所有时刻保持一致，然后我们
have all their moments aligned at least
for for the purpose of today and then we

24
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,939
如果我们感兴趣的话，可以稍后再进行远距离的偶极相互作用
can put back in the long range dipolar
interactions later if we're interested

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,890
所以我们将使用一个非常简单的模型来尝试了解发生了什么
so we're going to use a very simple
model to try to understand what happens

26
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,390
到有限温度下的磁化强度，我们使用自旋1/2缓和
to the magnetization at finite
temperature we use the spin 1/2 easing

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,259
通过旋转1/2缓和模型1/2缓和我们的意思是每个站点上的旋转
model 1/2 easing by spin 1/2 easing what
we mean is that the spin on each site

28
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,590
将是一些Sigma I指向Z方向，其中Sigma I等于加号或
will be some Sigma I pointing the Z
direction where Sigma I equals plus or

29
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,080
减1/2，我们将写之前见过的哈密顿量
minus 1/2 and we'll write the
Hamiltonian which we've seen before

30
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,570
所有部位的总和将与外部磁场耦合
there will be a coupling to the external
magnetic field the sum over all sites

31
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:24,550
 Sigma I和这里我将外部磁场放在Z方向上
Sigma I and here I've put the external
magnetic field in the Z direction and

32
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:31,720
那么我们将相邻自旋之间的耦合减去1/2 J总和
then we have the coupling between
neighbor spins minus 1/2 J sum over

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,840
相邻的旋转I和J Sigma I Sigma J，所以括号表示法也是
neighboring spins I and J Sigma I Sigma
J so again the bracket notation means

34
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,740
我和J是邻居，在这里我们关心的是铁磁体，所以我们
that I and J are neighbors and here
we're concerned with a ferromagnet so we

35
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:50,900
将J设置为大于零好吧，这就是缓动模型
set J greater than zero alright so this
is the easing model a fairly simple

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,650
模型写下来，但正如我之前提到的，实际上很难
model to write down but as I mentioned
before it's actually quite difficult to

37
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,760
解决它在一维可解决的二维问题
solve it is solvable in one dimension in
two dimensions it's solvable without the

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,720
磁场，除此之外，它根本无法解决，这意味着我们
magnetic field and beyond that it's not
solvable at all so that means we're

39
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,290
将不得不诉诸某种近似方法来获得某种
going to have to resort to some sort of
approximation method to get some sort of

40
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,650
了解磁化缓动模型的有限状态
understanding of what happens to the
magnetization the easing model at finite

41
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,780
现在有很多可以使用的近似方法，但是
temperature now there's lots of
approximation methods one can use but

42
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,370
理论家的首选或流氓的首选是
the first resort of theorists or first
resort of scoundrels is what's known as

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:25,850
平均场理论平均场理论，我们将使用它来尝试
mean field theory mean field theory
which we're going to use to try to

44
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,520
估计在有限温度下哈密顿量会发生什么
estimate what happens to this
Hamiltonian at finite temperature so

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:40,630
平均场理论可以近似定义为： 
mean field theory can be approximately
defined as whenever you approximate some

46
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:54,830
运算符或数量
operator or quantity some operator or
quantity with an expectation with an

47
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,390
平均或均值
average or a mean

48
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,520
这不仅在凝聚态物理中非常普遍
and this is used very very commonly not
only in condensed matter physics but

49
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,060
也在凝聚态物理之外，这是一个非常普遍的
also outside of condensed matter physics
and this is sort of a very general

50
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,060
语句，所以有很多事情可以作为一个近似值开始
statement so there are many things that
you can start approximating as a

51
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,200
期望值是平均值，因此我们将使用特定的
expectation are an average so we're
going to use a particular variety of

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:26,680
平均场理论被称为分子场理论或也被称为
mean field theory known as molecular
field theory theory or also it's known

53
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,490
作为副均场理论副均场理论MFT这是同一个人
as vice mean field theory vice mean
field theory MFT this is the same guy

54
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:40,180
副教授，他发现了磁铁中的畴的概念，并讨论了他
vice who was discovered the idea of
domains in magnets as well discussed him

55
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,960
上次，我不得不承认我不知道是在E之前还是在E之前
last time and I have to admit I don't
know if it's I before E or E before I

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,270
抱歉，我的拼写不是很好，所以
there so apologize about that my
spelling is not very good so the idea of

57
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:55,450
分子场论它基本上有两个非常简单的步骤，您可以
molecular field theory it has basically
two very simple steps that you can

58
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,830
始终遵循第一步是您应该对待系统的一部分
always follow step one is that you
should treat one piece of the system

59
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,300
确切地说，您隔离了系统的一小部分，它可能是一个单元
exactly you isolate one little piece of
the system it might be a single unit

60
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,890
单元格，或者它可能只是一个站点，您将要对其进行精确处理
cell or it might be just a single site
and you're going to treat that exactly

61
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:20,970
所以精确地对待一个系统正确地对待一个系统
so treat one piece of system exactly
treat one piece of system exactly

62
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:35,889
其他所有的东西都应该平均，所以我们实际上已经看到
everything else should be averaged all
else is averaged so we've actually seen

63
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:39,580
在我们研究固体的爱因斯坦模型之前
something like this before when we study
the Einstein model of the solid we

64
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,930
正确地处理了一个原子，我们正确地将其视为量子力学，但是我们
treated one atom exactly we treated as
quantum mechanics correctly but we

65
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:48,280
将所有其他原子的电势平均化，使之变得粗糙
average the potential from all the other
atoms we sort of made it into some rough

66
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,840
平均，一个原子刚好成为这个近似势
average and it just became this
approximate potential well that one atom

67
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,490
即使是非常粗略的近似，也存在一个原子
is living in so even though it was very
crude approximation is that one atom we

68
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,760
说实话，这是所有邻居的全部影响
treated very honestly it was all the
effect of all the neighbors that we

69
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,830
近似维塞处理手段的第二步理论
approximated the second step of vyse
means to deal theory

70
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,760
第二步是自洽自洽
step two is self-consistency
self-consistency

71
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,550
这意味着所有作品的所有作品都应该相同，并且在
which means all pieces all pieces should
be the same should look the same in the

72
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:28,190
末尾应该看起来一样，所以不管是哪一部分
end should look same at the end and so
it shouldn't matter which part of the

73
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:32,960
我们专注于对整个系统进行精确处理的系统
system we focus on to treat exactly at
the end of the day the whole system

74
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,200
应该再次看起来均匀，关于一件应该没什么特别的
should look homogeneous again shouldn't
be anything special about the one piece

75
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,910
我们要看一下，对我们来说，我们要对待宽松政策
we're going to look at so for us we're
going to we're going to treat the easing

76
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,120
铁磁体，我们将只关注一个站点中的一个单元电池
ferromagnet and we're going to focus in
on just one site a one unit cell in this

77
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,440
如果缓动铁磁体的晶胞是一个单一的站点，那么我们
case the easing ferromagnet the unit
cell is a single site so the we so we

78
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:59,330
专注于好，所以第一步看一个站点看一个站点我
focus on okay so step one look at one
site look at one site site I for the

79
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,440
缓和铁磁体我只为站点写下哈密顿量
easing ferromagnet I'll write down the
Hamiltonian for site I only so

80
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:10,280
站点I的哈密顿量是GμBB乘以Sigma I，即与
Hamiltonian for site I is G mu B B times
Sigma I that's the coupling to the

81
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,590
外部施加的磁场，然后将耦合到所有
externally applied magnetic field then
there's going to be the coupling to all

82
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:25,990
杰伊（Jay）是我的邻居I I Sigma J 
of its neighbors which I'll write this
this way jay is neighbor of i I Sigma J

83
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:30,860
然后乘上西格玛一世，所以我写出了哈密顿量的所有术语
and then times Sigma I so I've written
out all the terms in the Hamiltonian

84
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:38,510
包含自旋Sigma I的代码现在您可能已经在这里想了一秒钟
that contain the spin Sigma I right now
you may have thought here for a second

85
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:42,590
我可能会降低写在上面的1/2的因数，但我没有
that I may have dropped the factor of
1/2 that's written up top but I haven't

86
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:47,780
然后记住顶部的1/2的因数在那里，因为
then remember that the factor of 1/2 of
top is there because in that sum

87
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,740
严格来说，有Sigma 1 Sigma 2但也有Sigma 2 Sigma 1 
strictly speaking there's Sigma 1 Sigma
2 but there's also Sigma 2 Sigma 1 in

88
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,080
如果Sigma I是Sigma 1，那么这个总和不会反过来发生
this sum if Sigma I is Sigma 1 it
doesn't occur the other way around it

89
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,990
仅发生一次，因此Sigma 2 Sigma 1在此仅代表一次
only occurs once so Sigma 2 Sigma 1
would just be represented once in this

90
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,520
哈密​​顿量，这样写时就不需要1/2的因数
Hamiltonian so you don't need the factor
of 1/2 when you write it this way all

91
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,770
对，所以看起来有点复杂，让我们看看是否可以简化一下
right so this looks a little complicated
let's see if we can simplify it a little

92
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:19,040
位将写入将定义定义有效磁场是有效的
bit will write will define define an
effective magnetic field be effective be

93
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,320
通过以下方程式有效
effective via the following equation G
mu B

94
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:31,360
有效等于GM是外部磁场的实际磁场或
be effective equals GM you be the actual
magnetic field the external plus or

95
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,409
减去邻居J的影响乘以小J的总和是的邻居
minus the influence of the neighbors J
times sum over small J is a neighbor of

96
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:48,040
我是Sigma J的成员，所以我们正在做的是
I of I Sigma J so what we're doing is
we're wrapping up the interaction with

97
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,400
邻居，我们称它为有效磁场的一部分
the neighbors and we're calling it part
of the effective magnetic field okay in

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,400
我们可以将站点I的哈密顿量重写为G 
terms of this quantity we can rewrite
the Hamiltonian for site I as just G

99
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:08,230
可能是有效时间Sigma I，它看起来非常简单
maybe be effective times Sigma I which
looks extremely simple it just looks

100
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,690
像单自旋Sigma I耦合到外部有效磁场
like a single spin Sigma I coupled to an
external effective magnetic field be

101
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,720
有效，我们知道如何解决，我们解决了之前
effective and we know how to solve that
we solved that before which is have a

102
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,890
磁场中的单自旋应该很容易吧，好吧
single spin in a magnetic field it
should be easy right well okay that's a

103
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,030
有点欺骗性，因为我们在这里撒谎是有效的，而不仅仅是
little deceptive because we've sort of
lied here be effective is not just a

104
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:28,480
这里的数字不是常数它实际上具有一定的自由度
number here it's not a constant it
actually has some degrees of freedom a

105
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,780
隐藏在其中，您应该将其视为具有所有这些Sigma J的运算符
hidden in it you should think of it as
an operator it has all these Sigma J's

106
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,470
它使生活变得复杂，这会使一切变得非常复杂，因此
in it and that complicates life is going
to make everything really complicated so

107
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,900
我们真的不能简单地将其视为与恒定磁场耦合的自旋
we can't really treat this simply as a
spin coupled to a constant magnetic

108
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:45,610
场好吧，这就是我的意思场论派上用场了
field okay so that's what I mean field
theory comes in handy the rule of mean

109
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,240
场论认为，除了这一点之外，您应该近似一切
field theory is that you should
approximate everything except this one

110
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:58,060
按照平均值旋转，因此第一步近似是有效的
spin in terms of an average so step one
step one is approximate be effective by

111
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,820
有效平均值的总和将是有效的
sum average of the effective average
would be effective okay by taking this

112
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,360
平均而不是运算符，现在只是一个数字，因此
average instead of being an operator
it's now just a number so the

113
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,160
哈密​​顿量成为系统一哈密顿量成为HI是G mu B 
Hamiltonian becomes system one the
Hamiltonian becomes H I is G mu B

114
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,110
对有效的期望，现在只是一些
expectation of the effective which is
now just a number

115
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,260
耦合到Sigma I，而实际上只是一个自旋耦合到一个常数
coupled to Sigma I and that really is
just a single spin coupled to a constant

116
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,440
磁场，所以我们知道如何解决这个问题
magnetic field so we know how to solve
this we've done it before

117
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,720
我们做到了，您去年做到了，我们在上一讲中做到了，所以我只是
we did it you've done it last year we
did it in the last lecture so I'll just

118
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,630
写下第一步，写下分区函数
write down the first step you write down
the partition function its

119
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:45,710
您-βG mu B期望值，并且对我的有效x加上1/2加上e 
you the - beta G mu B expectation and be
effective x plus 1/2 plus e to the my

120
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:54,140
 G mu beta G me B期望有效倍数1/2 
G mu beta G me B expectation be
effective times 1/2

121
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,260
我希望这看起来很熟悉，然后我们可以在
I hope this looks familiar then we can
differentiate this partition function in

122
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:06,050
为了获得对Sigma I的期望，然后对Sigma I的期望变为
order to get expectation of Sigma I and
the expectation of Sigma I then becomes

123
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:17,260
 βG mu B期望的负1/2双曲正切值和有效时间
minus 1/2 hyperbolic tangent of beta G
mu B expectation and be effective times

124
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:25,010
 1/2好，现在我们有了Sigma I的表达式
1/2 okay so now we have an expression
for Sigma I for the expectation of Sigma

125
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:31,520
 I在外部有效磁场方面的温度和Gμ 
I in terms of the external the effective
magnetic field the temperature and G mu

126
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,440
 B到目前为止对这个好东西感到满意，所以现在
B so far so good
happy with this alright good so now the

127
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,430
最后一步是我们必须弄清楚有效的期望是什么
last step is we have to figure out what
this expectation of the effective is

128
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:48,620
好，这样期望就这样G mu B有效的期望就是G 
okay so expectation right this way G mu
B expectation of the effective is just G

129
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:59,450
 mu B是外部磁场减去J加上J的总和不是
mu B be the external magnetic field
minus J sum over J isn't is neighbor of

130
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:11,840
我对Sigma J的期望倍，所以我只取了
I of I times expectation of Sigma J okay
so I just took the average of of the

131
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:18,860
在这里有效，平均场理论的最后一步是最后
effective here and the the final step of
the mean field theory is that at the end

132
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:24,220
当天所有站点的外观应该相同，因此站点I的Sigma平均值
of the day all sites should look the
same so the average of Sigma on site I

133
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:29,500
应该与平均值相同，所以这是第二步自洽
should be the same as the average of so
this is step two self-consistency

134
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,860
 I站点Sigma的平均值应与J站点的Sigma平均值相同
average of Sigma on site I should be the
same as the average of Sigma on site J

135
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,130
我和网站Jane的网站并没有什么特别之处，我们称之为
there's nothing special about site I
versus site Jane we'll just call it

136
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:42,290
西格玛好吧，所以我们只是将西格玛的平均值设置为每个
Sigma okay so we're just setting the
average of Sigma the same on every every

137
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:48,130
站点，所以如果我们这样做，那么我们的方程式就是
site so if we do that then our equation
here with the tange

138
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:56,470
双曲正切可以写成Sigma等于负1/2双曲
the hyperbolic tangent can be written as
Sigma equals minus 1/2 hyperbolic

139
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:03,759
切线，现在我将在有效的地方插入B的表达式
tangent and now I'll plug in our
expression for B effective where well

140
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:12,519
实际上好吧，好吧，我想这是一笔总和
actually all right well okay up here
this sum here I suppose

141
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,850
这里的和可以是Z乘以Sigma，其中Z是邻居的数量
this sum here it can be Z times Sigma
where Z is the number of neighbors sorry

142
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:28,810
自从我们将Sigma J的Sigma期望设置为正好是这个以来的邻居数量
number of neighbors since we set Sigma
expectation of Sigma J to be just this

143
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:34,060
数字Sigma，总和中有J个项，总和中有D个项很清楚
number Sigma and there's J terms in the
sum D terms in the sum is that clear

144
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,449
我只是对不起，有点混乱
what I just did
sorry it was a little messy okay all

145
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:45,279
对，所以最终结果是有形的减去beta JZ超过2倍
right so this ends up coming out
tangible minus beta J Z over 2 times

146
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:54,370
 Sigma加beta G mu BB超过2，所以这只是对
Sigma plus beta G mu B B over 2 so this
is just a rewriting of this of the

147
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,740
我插入的双曲正切的等式在那里有效
equation up there with the hyperbolic
tangent I plugged in be effective and I

148
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:07,389
插入了J倍Z 4，其中我有J倍期望J倍Z倍Sigma 
plugged in J times Z 4 where I had J
times expectation J times Z times Sigma

149
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:12,190
是我的J倍于邻居的总和乘以Sigma J的期望值的地方
is where I had J times sum over
neighbors times expectation of Sigma J

150
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:18,160
好是好好的好的好的好的，这是我们的最终结果
good yes good all right all right all
right so this is our our final result

151
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:23,380
这是Sigma幅度的某种自洽方程
and it's some sort of self-consistent
equation for the magnitude of Sigma

152
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,660
这是在站点I上旋转的期望，因此原则上我们现在有了
which is the expectation that's spin on
site I and so in principle we now have

153
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:34,329
我们针对Sigma的解决方案是耦合温度的函数
our solution for what Sigma is as a
function of the temperature the coupling

154
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:38,050
到邻居的数量邻居外部磁场的数量
to the neighbors the number of neighbors
external magnetic field okay it's a

155
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,189
复杂的方程式，但至少在原则上我们可以立即解决
complicated equation but at least in
principle we could solve it the moment

156
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:49,360
那么每个站点将减去GμB乘以Sigma，此处的标记就可以了
per site would then be minus G mu B
times Sigma where the sign so okay this

157
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,480
是每个自旋的时刻，负号来自电子
is the moment per for spin this minus
sign comes from the fact that electrons

158
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,420
带有负电荷，因此磁矩指向相反的方向
have negative charge so the magnetic
moment points in the opposite direction

159
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:02,270
的旋转，所以原则上我们现在已经解决了
of the spin
so in principle we've now solved our

160
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:07,760
问题，但这是一个复杂的先验方程， 
problem however this is sort of a
complicated transcendental equation and

161
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,870
它的解决方案不是很明显，我们已经看到了Sigma的一些方程式，所以我们
it's not so obvious what its solution is
we've seen some equation for Sigma so we

162
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:21,440
必须弄清楚如何解决它，让我们先简化为一个简单的案例
have to figure out how to solve it and
let's simplify to a easy case first so

163
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,930
情况情况1r只是将情况设为零，外部磁场为0 
case case 1r just set the case to be
equal zero external magnetic field is 0

164
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:34,420
在这种情况下，简化这个方程式，使符号向内移动，我们得到的Sigma为1/2 
in which case simplifying this equation
moving a sign inside we get Sigma is 1/2

165
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:44,840
 βJZ Sigma超过2的双曲正切值对
hyperbolic tangent of beta J Z Sigma
over 2 good still a hard equation to

166
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,360
解决，因为它仍然是Sigma的超越方程，但
solve because it's still a
transcendental equation for Sigma but

167
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,460
有一个很好的图形方法可以解决这个方程，即绘制y等于
there's a nice graphical way to solve
this equation which is to plot y equals

168
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:06,050
 Sigma和y等于在同一图上的2上超过2的1/2 tange beta JZ Sigma 
Sigma and y equals 1/2 tange beta J Z
Sigma over 2 on the same plot and where

169
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,920
他们相交是这个方程的解好，所以这就是我们要
they intersect is the solution of this
equation ok so that's what we're gonna

170
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,410
这样做就是我们要解决这个问题的方式，每个人都还在我身边
do that's how we're going to solve this
equation is everyone still with me

171
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:22,490
任何人都可以，是的，所以很好，所以我们首先要决定并移交
anyone happy yeah ok good so so here we
go first we have to decide and put over

172
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:30,920
这里好吧，我们在这里Y西格玛在这里啊温度西格玛吧
here ok let's all right here Y Sigma
over here ah temperature Sigma right

173
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,820
 Sigma在这里，然后我们绘制第一个曲线y等于Sigma 
Sigma over here then we'll plot the
first curve which is y equals Sigma like

174
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:42,980
这个y等于Sigma ok，这是我们要绘制的第一条曲线，然后
this y equals Sigma ok that's the first
curve that we want to plot and then the

175
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:49,370
第二条曲线是该双曲正切，渐近于1/2和负1/2 
second curve is this hyperbolic tangent
which asymptotes at 1/2 and at minus 1/2

176
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,880
所以我们在这里渐近动物渐近线但是有两个
so we'll asymptote here animal
asymptotes down here but there's two

177
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:01,600
夸张哎呀这个图看起来是什么样的可能性
possibilities as to what this plot looks
like with the hyperbole oops and

178
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:09,859
双曲正切双曲正切看起来像什么
hyperbolic hyperbolic tangent what this
hyperbolic tangent looks like one

179
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,999
可能是低温发生什么情况低温

180
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,819
没开抱歉先做高温高温高温
not open sorry let's do high temperature
first high temperature high temperature

181
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:25,189
是第一种可能性，因此在高温下β很小，因此棕褐色
is the first possibility so in high
temperature beta is small and so the tan

182
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:32,179
 CH是一个非常柔和的功能，因此看起来像这样，所以这是
CH is a very gentle function so it looks
kind of like this okay so this is the

183
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,309
低温高温
low high temperature high temperature

184
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,950
好人对此感到满意，那就是双曲线正切曲线
good people happy with that that's a
hyperbolic tangent curve and it

185
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,799
渐近线到这条虚线，所以我们看到的是这两条曲线
asymptotes to this dotted line so what
we see is these two curves the

186
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,210
双曲正切且y等于Sigma曲线仅在一个点处相交
hyperbolic tangent and the y equals
Sigma curve intersect only at one point

187
00:17:53,210 --> 00:18:00,500
 Sigma等于0，所以唯一的唯一解决方案是Sigma等于
at Sigma equals zero so the only
solution only solution is Sigma equals

188
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,640
零，这告诉我们您在高温下没有铁磁性
zero and that tells us that you don't
have ferromagnetism in high temperature

189
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:11,450
实际上，您得到的M等于磁化强度等于零或顺磁性，而不是
you in fact get M equals magnetization
equals zero or paramagnetism rather than

190
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:22,520
亚铁磁性顺磁性不是高温下的铁磁性
ferrimagnetism paramagnetism not
ferromagnetism at high temperature high

191
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:29,870
温度，这实际上比任何坚固的磁铁都更为典型
temperature and this is actually quite
typical than any firm magnet if you

192
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,340
在某个时候升高温度，顺磁性就会消失，您
raise it in temperature at some point
the pro magnetism will go away and you

193
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,669
有这样的直觉，这就是
have this sort of intuition that what's
that's coming from is that the the

194
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:41,780
瞬间的温度波动很大，以至于最终停止
moments are fluctuating thermally around
so much that they eventually stop

195
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,770
指向任何特定方向，如果不指向，则不指向任何方向
pointing in any particular direction and
they don't point in any if they're not

196
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,559
指向任何特定的方向，它不再是铁磁体，并且
pointing in any particular direction
it's not a ferromagnet anymore and in

197
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,000
事实上，这将在几分钟内成为一个顺磁性小表演，现在其他
fact it will be a paramagnet a little
show in a few moments okay now the other

198
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,900
可能是因为我们处于低温状态，所以请考虑一下
possibility is it we're at low
temperature so think about that

199
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,950
可能低温，在这种情况下双曲正切
possibility low temperature in which
case the hyperbolic tangent is a much

200
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,919
这样的曲线比较陡，因为双曲正切的参数是
steeper curve like this because the
argument of the hyperbolic tangent is

201
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,659
较大，因为在低温下β较大，因此实际上有三个
larger because beta is larger at low
temperature and so in fact there's three

202
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:19,640
解决方案，所以这是低温曲线，低温，所以我们有一个
solutions so this is the low temperature
curve low temperature so we have a

203
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,620
这里的解叫Sigma N等于T，在0处有一个解
solution here call that Sigma naught of
T there's a solution at 0 and then

204
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,490
这里有一个解决方案，我们称其为负Sigma naught 
there's a solution here which we'll call
minus Sigma naught

205
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:36,880
茶，所以我们得到三到三个解决方案，三个解决方案分别是Sigma等于
tea so we get three to three solutions
three solutions which are Sigma equals

206
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,000
零，然后加上或减去T的Sigma零就将事实设为零
zero and then plus or minus Sigma naught
of T turn on zero the fact that we have

207
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,040
 Sigma的非零解告诉我们我们有一个铁磁体， 
nonzero solutions for Sigma it's telling
us that we have a ferromagnet and

208
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,870
铁磁体自然可以使其向上旋转或可以使其旋转
naturally the ferromagnet can have it
spins pointing up or it can have its

209
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:58,059
向下旋转，所以这些是铁磁解决方案，这不是
spins pointing down so these are the
ferromagnetic solutions and this is not

210
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:01,780
令人惊讶，因为我们知道如果您将温度降至零
surprising because we know that if you
go down to zero temperature this curve

211
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:06,400
事实上，它将变得非常陡峭
will be extremely steep it will
intersect right here as a matter of fact

212
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,790
然后您将完全意识到西格玛对西格玛的期望是
and you'll get complete polarization
that Sigma the expectation of Sigma is

213
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,929
 1/2表示所有旋转都指向完全相同的方向，这样
1/2 meaning all the spins point in
exactly the same direction okay so that

214
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:18,010
将是您在零温度和更高温度下得到的
would be what you get at zero
temperature at higher temperature the

215
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:22,620
交点向下移动到稍低的点，您会变小
intersection moves down to a slightly
lower point and you get slightly smaller

216
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,530
 Sigma的T值没有，所以磁化强度略小，但不为零
Sigma naught of T so you get slightly
smaller magnetization but not zero

217
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,780
磁化现在我们可能想知道这个家伙呢，我们还有另一个
magnetization now we might wonder what
about this guy here we have another

218
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:36,460
告诉我们我们期望Sigma为0的解决方案
solution which tells us we have an
expectation of Sigma being 0 and this

219
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,830
一个人实际上是有点困惑，事实证明这不是一个物理解决方案
one actually is a little puzzling it
turns out it's a not a physical solution

220
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,640
不是身体上的，您实际上会证明这是您的一项作业
not physical and you'll actually show
that for one of your homework

221
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,800
作业，所以事实证明您要做的作业是
assignments so it turns out what you'll
show for your homework is that this

222
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,110
我们求解的自洽方程实际上与x Extra相同
self-consistent equation that we solve
is actually the same thing as x extra

223
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,120
玉米释放出一种自由能，正如您所知，当您额外将一些玉米化时，您可以
maizing a free energy and as you know
when you extra Mize something you can

224
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,750
要么得到最大值，要么得到最小值，所以我们得到了-我们得到了一个最大值
either get a maximum or a minimum so
we're get-- we're getting one maximum

225
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:08,590
而自由能的两个最小值，最小值是自由能
and two minima of the free energies the
minimum are the free energies are the

226
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:12,250
物理上实现的东西和最大的自由能是排序的
things that are realized physically and
the maximum of the free energy is sort

227
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,150
会从方程式中得出错误，但这在物理上还不行， 
of a mistake it comes out of the
equations but it's not physical okay and

228
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,000
当您实际写下自由能时，它会更加清晰
it's much clearer when you actually
write down the free energy which you'll

229
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,480
做功课，您会明白为什么我们不保留该解决方案，所以这
do for homework and you'll see why it is
that we don't keep that solution so this

230
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,429
我们有点忽略，我们只跟踪这些铁磁解决方案
one we sort of ignore and we only keep
track of these ferromagnetic solutions

231
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,960
好吧，我们想知道在什么温度下
okay
so we'd like to know at what temperature

232
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,550
从做强磁铁变成做费罗磁铁，我们这样写
do we go from being a power magnet to
being a Ferro magnet let's write that

233
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:51,730
在什么茶下喝什么铁
down at what T
at what tea do we get ferromagnetism

234
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:59,600
嗯，实际上有一个TC的名称比您得到的TC小/ T 
well there's actually a name for that TC
is known as a / T less than TC you get

235
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,620
铁磁性farrell mag和TC被称为居里温度Curie tam 
ferromagnetism farrell mag and TC is
known as the curie temperature curie tam

236
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:14,210
或临界温度临界温度，低于此温度则为Ferro 
or the critical temperature critical
temp below which you have Ferro

237
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:20,420
磁性，所以我们想知道什么时候获得TC或何时获得
magnetism so we'd like to know when do
we get what is TC or when do we get this

238
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:25,310
铁磁磁性在什么温度以下都可以看到
Ferro magnetism below what temperature
well the way to see that again looking

239
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,780
图形化地认识到拥有一个解决方案之间的过渡
graphically is to realize that the
transition between having one solution

240
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,760
当双曲正切函数为
having three solutions occurs when the
hyperbolic tangent the function is

241
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,310
与y完全相切的Sigma线与
exactly tangent to the y equals Sigma
line where it lines up just exactly with

242
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:45,830
相同的斜率，这就是重点所在的原因
the same slope and the reason that
that's the important point where where

243
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,940
从顺磁性到铁磁性的转变是
the where you have the transition from
paramagnetism to Ferro magnetism is

244
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,930
因为如果双曲正切不那么陡峭，您将只有一个
because if the hyperbolic tangent were
any less steep you'd have only one

245
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,100
解决方案，如果还有更多解决方案，您可以采用三种解决方案，因此我们必须
solution and if it were any more steep
you have three solutions so we have to

246
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,940
寻找双曲正切具有完全相同的情况
look for the for the situation where the
hyperbolic tangent has exactly the same

247
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:24,260
斜率y等于Sigma，所以TC从找到切线X的切线斜率开始
slope is y equals Sigma okay so TC from
finding slope of tangent of tangent X

248
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:33,140
在此处平移y等于切线tantra设置等于1的斜率是beta jay-z 
pand the y equals tangent here the slope
of tantra set equal to one is beta jay-z

249
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:42,490
超过四个或只是重新排列一点，我们得到KB TC等于四个以上的JZ 
over four or just rearranging a little
bit we get KB T C equals JZ over four

250
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:46,640
这是温度的关键值，还可以吗？ 
which is the critical value of
temperature okay is everyone still with

251
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:55,460
我还算开心，不，是的，嗯，也许好吧，让我暂停一下
me fairly fairly happy no yes maybe okay
um maybe alright so let me just pause

252
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:04,550
好一秒钟，现在是时候喝巧克力了
for a second to sort of okay well it's
time for chocolate actually so um so for

253
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:11,870
对于一块巧克力棒，杰伊-z认为什么至关重要？ 
for one chocolate bar what's the what's
the critical importance of jay-z think

254
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,530
开箱即用，真的很好，谁说我
outside the box
well it's really good who said that I

255
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,110
会说他已经嫁给了碧昂丝，但已经足够亲密了
was gonna say he's married to Beyonce
but it's close enough

256
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:27,290
是的，所以很好，是的，没有，杰伊-z除了我之外，碧昂丝阿姨
yeah so yeah very good yeah okay no did
jay-z is besides me auntie Beyonce the

257
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:31,700
 Jay-z的重要性在这里，实际上是在告诉您， 
importance of jay-z here is that it's in
fact it's telling you that okay one

258
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:37,070
母亲花花公子知道碧昂斯的中间名，你知道那是她的最后一次
mother dudes anyone know beyoncé's
middle name do you know that's her last

259
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:44,390
名字不，不，那是你姐姐的名字，是的，不，不，甚至都不知道， 
name no no that's your sister's name
yeah come on no no didn't even know and

260
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:50,960
碧昂斯（Beyonce）的宝宝的名字，是的，有人在那边买了，是的，我有一个
Beyonce's baby's name yeah someone got
it over there yes yeah okay I have one

261
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:57,680
对你来说还好吧，所以好吧，jay-z的重要之处是
for you also alright okay so does okay
um the important of jay-z here is

262
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,270
实际上，这是自旋与其邻居耦合的总能量
actually it's a total amount of energy
of coupling of the spin to its neighbors

263
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:09,260
所以我们这里有Z个邻居，J是
and so we have Z neighbors here and J is
the amount of the coupling strength from

264
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,220
旋转到它的每个邻居，所以当温度高于
the spin to each of its neighbors so
when the temperature gets above the

265
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,390
与其邻居的耦合强度总量，热波动
total amount of coupling strength to its
neighbors the fluctuation in the thermal

266
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,070
这种旋转的波动使它想要停留在
fluctuations of that spin so overwhelm
the amount that it wants to stay in the

267
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:26,120
与邻居的方向相同，这就是它想要的铁磁体的原因
same direction as its neighbors which is
what's keeping it a ferromagnet it wants

268
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,270
与邻居有相同的方向，当能量
to have the same direction as its
neighbors and when the energy of the

269
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,480
热能刚好大于将其保持在原位的能量
thermal energy is just greater than the
energy holding it in place

270
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,980
你会失去铁磁性，好吧，这就是这张照片背后的直觉
you lose ferromagnetism okay that's the
intuition behind this picture here

271
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:44,480
好吧，好吧，至少可以在图形上拍摄这张照片， 
alright alright anyway so at least
graphically we can take this picture and

272
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,090
我们可以将Sigma作为T的函数进行求解，只需找出
we can solve for Sigma as a function of
T you just have to figure out where

273
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,920
当我们改变T时，有两条曲线交叉，我们将得到一张图片， 
where there's two curves cross as we
change T and we'll get a picture that

274
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,870
看起来有点像这里的温度
looks kind of like this here's
temperature

275
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:03,470
这是零温度下的Sigma Sigma实际上是一半，因为所有
here's Sigma at zero temperature Sigma
is actually a half because all all the

276
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:07,700
自旋对齐，然后在TCC处变为零， 
spins are aligned
and then at TCC it goes to zero and

277
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:14,440
高于TC，则完全为零，但随后下降到这样的水平
above above TC it's exactly zero but
then it comes down kind of like this at

278
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,320
改变T的温度是有限的，所以实际上
finite temperature as you've changed T
so this is actually gives you the

279
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,640
所得到的魔力是多少的状态方程是一个函数
equation of state of how much Magn is a
ssin you get is a function of

280
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,990
温度，您可以从这个平均场近似中得到它，这并不精确
temperature and you can get it from this
mean field approximation it's not exact

281
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:32,480
但这是相当不错的，所以最后一步是我向你保证
but it's it's fairly good okay all right
so the last step is that I promised you

282
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,510
在这个地区，我们有一个顺磁性，所以我们应该拒绝
that up in this region here we have a
paramagnet so we should reject and

283
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,330
说服自己这确实是一个顺磁性，而做到这一点的一种方法是
convince ourselves it really is a
paramagnet and one way to do that is to

284
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:45,890
计算磁化率，以便我们知道的事情就在该区域
calculate susceptibility so things that
we know is up in this region if you

285
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,150
如果不施加磁场，则不施加磁场sigma为0 
don't apply a magnetic field sigma is 0
if you apply a small magnetic field then

286
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,450
 sigma可能接近0，所以我们可以做的就是
sigma is probably gonna be close to 0 so
what we can do is we can take our

287
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,580
原始的自洽方程，我们可以将其扩展为
original self-consistency equation and
we can expand it for small argument of

288
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,210
双曲正切，因为里面的所有东西都是根据定义
the hyperbolic tangent because
everything inside there is by definition

289
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:08,420
小C西格玛小B小小一切都小，所以我们可以写
small C the Sigma is smaller B is small
everything is small so we can write

290
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,460
西格玛等于，她只是把这全部写下来，我要吸收一些
Sigma equals and she's just writing this
all out I'm going to absorb a couple of

291
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:23,900
此处的负号beta超过2的JC Sigma负值超过2磁场的beta G mu B 
minus signs here beta J C Sigma over 2
minus beta G mu B over 2 magnetic field

292
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:32,000
好的，然后我们重新安排它，以便我们将Sigma作为
ok and then we just rearrange this in so
we solve for Sigma as a function of

293
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:41,630
磁场，这样我们就可以得到Sigma IPL，即1减去JZ超过4个beta等于
magnetic field we get Sigma IPL right
this way 1 minus JZ over 4 beta equals

294
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:49,040
减去βGμB超过4倍的磁场，这一点是
minus beta G mu B over 4 times the
magnetic field and this notice this

295
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,430
这里的数量实际上是TC，是KBT，因此我们进行了一些重新排列
quantity here is actually TC is KBT see
so with a little bit more rearranging we

296
00:27:55,430 --> 00:28:07,150
得到的西格玛等于负1/4 GμB磁场B除以KBT减去KB 
get Sigma equals minus 1/4 G mu B
magnetic field B divided by KBT minus KB

297
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:14,810
 TC，然后我们实际上希望将其转换为某种敏感性
TC and then we want to actually convert
this into some sort of susceptibility so

298
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:22,640
磁矩为负G mu B Sigma和磁化强度，所以这是
the magnetic moment is minus G mu B
Sigma and magnetization so this is a

299
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,050
可见时刻，磁化强度是每个站点的时间乘以Rho 
moment for sight the magnetization is
the moment per site times Rho the

300
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:36,860
旋转密度旋转密度然后是
density of spins density of spins and
then the susceptibility will be mu

301
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:47,300
根据定义，dm DB在b处等于零，这只是插入了一对
naught by definition d m DB at b equals
zero which just plugging in a couple

302
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:58,450
在这里排队，然后得到KBT的1/4 rhg g b平方平方
lines up here we get then get 1/4 rho g
mu b squared mu naught over KBT

303
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:08,300
 1乘以1减去TC乘以t，这整个数量实际上是
times 1 over 1 minus TC over t and this
whole quantity here is actually the

304
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,780
居里磁化率居里自旋1/2，换句话说就是我们的磁化率
Curie susceptibility curie for a spin
1/2 in other words its susceptibility we

305
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,309
本来可以计算出我们只是自由旋转1/2，实际上这正是我们
would have calculated we've just a free
spin 1/2 in fact it is exactly what we

306
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:23,300
当我们计算自旋1/2 in的磁化率时计算
calculated when we calculated the
magnetic susceptibility of a spin 1/2 in

307
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,040
最后一堂课，然后整个结果乘以1减去1 
the last lecture but then this whole
thing gets multiplied by 1 over 1 minus

308
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:34,240
 TC超过t，所以我们的权力巨头对TC的敏感性是
TC over t so the susceptibility of our
power magnate above TC is a

309
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,900
只是一个与每个都不耦合的自由旋转1/2系统的磁化率
susceptibility of just a system of free
spin 1/2 which aren't coupled to each

310
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:43,460
其他和至少在免疫中耦合在缓和模型中的作用
other and the effect of the coupling in
the easing model at least with immune

311
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:49,130
场论就是将它乘以T的1减去TC 
field theory is to multiply it by this
factor of 1 minus TC over T ok now you

312
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,730
可能会注意到在临界温度或居里温度下
may notice that at the critical
temperature or the Curie temperature

313
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:58,640
这个因素有所不同，实际上是物理上的，这是真实的，其原因
this factor diverges and that actually
is physical it's real and the reason

314
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,840
是因为存在，因为我们必须记住，这种敏感性
it's it's there is because we have to
remember that that the susceptibility

315
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,070
告诉你打开一点点的磁化强度
tells you how much magnetization you get
when you turn on a little bit of

316
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,330
磁场的定义，但当您低于临界点时
magnetic field by its definition but
when you go below the critical

317
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:15,110
温度即使在0磁场下也会磁化，因此
temperature you get magnetization even
for 0 magnetic fields so the

318
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,750
易感性一定已经使无穷大了
susceptibility must have gotten the
infinite somewhere along a little on the

319
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,809
行，这就是这个词在这里所做的，好吧，所以这是
line so that's what this term is doing
there ok all right so this is the

320
00:30:23,809 --> 00:30:28,690
平均场理论的一般方案及其工作原理
general scheme of a mean field theory
and how it works

321
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,340
平均场论在哪里，是的平均场论
mean field theory where was it yeah mean
field theory

322
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:37,970
通常如何以平均方式近似某个算子
how it works where we generally
approximate some operator by an average

323
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:42,450
并且这种平均场理论技术可以更广泛地使用
and this technique of mean field theory
can be used much much more generally

324
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,330
比我们在这里做作业所要讲的平均场论
than what we did here for homework
you'll do a mean field theory

325
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,990
反铁磁体的计算以及轮渡磁体的计算
calculation for an antiferromagnet as
well you could do it for a ferry magnet

326
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,980
您可以将其旋转不到一半的事实
you could do it for spins that aren't
spin one-half the fact that we got a

327
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:58,350
整个故事中的双曲线正切来自于这样一个事实： 
hyperbolic tangent in this in this whole
story came from the fact that we were

328
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,679
考虑它旋转一半，所以如果我们旋转，它只会旋转向上和向下旋转
thinking about it spin one-half so it
had only spin up and spin down if we

329
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,580
在考虑自旋一时，我们将使自旋s D等于1 SZ等于0在Z 
were thinking about spin one we would
have spin s D equals 1 SZ equals 0 at Z

330
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,700
等于负1，我们会得到比双曲正切更复杂的东西
equals minus 1 we'd get something more
complicated than a hyperbolic tangent

331
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,140
我们会得到一个所谓的Brewin函数，但是关于您如何使用的一般主题
we'd get a so called Brewin function but
the general themes of how you how you

332
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,630
使其准确地对待系统的一部分，然后坚持
approach it treat one piece of the
system exactly and then insist on

333
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:22,409
自我一致性保持不变，并且该技术在外部使用
self-consistency that remains the same
and the technique is used outside of

334
00:31:22,409 --> 00:31:27,360
凝聚态的磁性用于理解液晶
magnetism in condensed matter it's used
for understanding liquid crystals it's

335
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,600
用于了解流感动力学，用于天体物理学，用于
used for understanding flu dynamics is
used in astrophysics it's used in

336
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,529
大气物理学平均场理论只是一种非常普遍的技术
atmospheric physics mean field theory is
just a very general technique that's

337
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:38,779
用于许多事情，对您有好处，可以将其思想内部化
used for many many things and it's good
to you know internalize the ideas of it

338
00:31:38,779 --> 00:31:44,970
好吧，我们将使用均值场理论来做另一件事
alright we were going to use mean field
theory for one more thing which is to

339
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:51,659
了解流动铁磁性流动剂是下一个主题
understand itinerant ferromagnetism
itinerant which is the next subject an

340
00:31:51,659 --> 00:32:00,270
流动磁力和“流动”一词的意思是基本上漂泊
itinerant magnetism and the word the
word itinerant means wandering basically

341
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,760
或有时它意味着迷失，但眼睛真正的意思是
or sometimes it means lost but the eye
what it really means is that the

342
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:16,549
磁矩由移动电子携带
magnetic moment moments are carried are
carried by mobile electrons by mobile

343
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:24,390
自从几年前我们开始谈论磁性以来，我们现在的电子
electrons now since we started talking
about magnetism a couple lectures ago we

344
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:29,039
考虑将磁矩放在站点上，磁矩可以
thought about putting magnetic moments
on sites and the magnetic moments could

345
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,970
向不同的方向移动，但我们没有考虑这种可能性
move in point in different directions
but we didn't consider the possibility

346
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:37,380
瞬间实际上可以从一个站点跳到另一个站点，但实际上
that the moments could actually hop from
one site to another site but in real

347
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,570
像铁这样的磁铁是非常典型的， 
magnets like an iron for example is
quite typical that the same things that

348
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:46,520
这些电子实际上也在四处移动
are giving you a magnetization these
electrons are actually moving around too

349
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:53,270
乐队，但他们设法给我们铁磁性，就像其他类型的
in bands and yet they managed to give us
ferromagnetism so as with other types of

350
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:58,340
磁力流动磁力是由相互作用产生的
magnetism itinerant magnetism is driven
by interactions it comes from the

351
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:08,210
电子之间的相互作用来自相互作用，所以我们必须以某种方式
interaction between electrons from from
interactions so somehow we have to

352
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:11,360
引入互动并至少在一定的平均范围内对待他们
introduce interactions and treat them at
least within some mean field

353
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,270
为了了解迭代磁，现在当然要进行一次近似
approximation in order to understand
itinerant magnetism now of course once

354
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,260
您开始介绍电子之间的相互作用事情变得复杂
you start introducing interactions
between electrons things get complicated

355
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:26,420
很快，所以我们需要一个非常简化的模型
very quickly so we need a very
simplified model which will represent

356
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,590
电子之间的相互作用，仍然赋予我们正确的权利
the interaction between electrons and
still give us the right the right

357
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:36,980
物理学，所以我们要使用的模型就是所谓的Hubbard模型Hubbard 
physics so the model we're going to use
is the so-called Hubbard model Hubbard

358
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:44,360
于1963年写下此书以试图了解流动磁场
wrote this down in 1963 to try to
understand itinerant magnetism and since

359
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:49,040
他写下来的话哈伯德模型拥有自己的巨大生命
he wrote this down the Hubbard model has
taken on a huge life of its own

360
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,020
它可能是相互作用电子的最重要模型
it's potentially it is probably the most
important model of interacting electrons

361
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,190
在所有物理学中都可能毫不夸张地说
in all of physics there have been
probably without exaggeration a hundred

362
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,940
关于Hubbard模型主题的数千篇论文是如此重要
thousand papers written on the subject
of the Hubbard model it's that important

363
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:05,660
之所以如此重要，是因为它异常出色
to the field and the reason it's so
important is because it's exceptionally

364
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,540
很简单，但是它的物理却非常复杂，所以哈伯德的方式
simple and yet its physics is quite
complex so but the way Hubbard

365
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,210
您知道在均值领域理论中对它的处理方法
you know treated it in mean field
theories what we're going to do here

366
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,000
这很简单，您可以获得很好的结果，这有助于您理解
it's fairly simple you get out a good
result which helps you understand

367
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,859
流动铁磁性，这就是我们要在模型中要做的
itinerant ferromagnetism which is what
we're going to do in the model it's

368
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:25,510
很简单，我们要做的是写一个哈密顿量
pretty straightforward what we do is we
start by writing a Hamiltonian that is

369
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:38,000
紧密结合紧密结合电子与一些跳跃
tight binding tight binding tight
binding electrons with hopping with some

370
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,679
跳变T和紧密结合电子的哈密顿量的这一部分
hopping T and this part of the
Hamiltonian of tight binding electrons

371
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,210
经过一些跳跃，我们已经解决了这个问题，然后才在
with some hopping we've solved this
before we looked at this earlier in the

372
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,139
术语，我们得到了这些余弦形带，您可以填充余弦形带
term we got these cosine shaped bands
you can fill up the cosine shaped bands

373
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:53,899
如果是半满的乐队，你会得到一个金属，如果是一个完整的乐队，你会得到一个
if it's a half filled band you get a
metal if it's a full band you get an

374
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,130
绝缘体，但绝不仅仅具有这种类型的结合电子
insulator but never in just this model
here with just type binding electrons

375
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,080
跳就可以得到铁磁体
with hopping would you ever get
ferromagnets

376
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:05,330
如果只有这种紧密的绑定结构，您将永远不会遇到任何情况
ism you'd never get a situation if you
only have this tight binding structure

377
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,650
你从哪里下来会有不同数量的上升时刻
you where you would ever have a
different number of up moments from down

378
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,070
时刻他们总是会出来的，所以我们必须添加一些东西
moments they would always come out even
so we have to add something to it which

379
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,800
将会改变故事以及我们要添加的内容
is going to change the story and what
we're adding to it

380
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,940
是我指定您使用的某些总体网站的互动条件大于
is the interaction term some overall
sites I parameter you use greater than

381
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,400
零倍于站点上的电子数量，我们自旋向上乘以
zero times the number of electrons on
site I we spin up times the number of

382
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,780
我们旋转的站点上的电子，然后写下这是电子的数量
electrons on site I we spin down then
write this this is number of electrons

383
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:48,200
在现场，我向下旋转就可以了，所以这是在告诉我
on site I with spin up down down okay so
what this is doing is this just telling

384
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,240
你，每当两个电子坐在你身上，你就会受到能量的惩罚
you that you get an energy penalty of
you whenever two electrons sit on the

385
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,780
同一站点上的相同原子好吧，我们实际上已经讨论过了
same atom on the same site okay and
we've actually discussed this

386
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,950
哈密​​顿量，我们没有使用“哈伯德模型”一词，但提醒您何时
Hamiltonian before we didn't use the
word Hubbard model but remind you when

387
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:08,450
我们讨论了Mod绝缘子Mod绝缘子我们讨论了一种情况
we talked about mod insulators mod
insulators we discussed a situation

388
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:11,990
电子之间的相互作用是如此强烈，以至于你只能将一个
where the interaction between electrons
was so strong that you can only put a

389
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:15,650
该站点上的单个电子，然后您会得到一个情况
single electron on the site and then you
get you can get a situation if there's a

390
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,250
现场只有一个电子，然后一切都冻结在交通堵塞中，因为没有
single electron on site then everything
gets frozen in a traffic jam because no

391
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,920
可以跳到附近的站点，因为已经有人坐在
one can hop to the neighboring site
because there's already someone sitting

392
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,620
在那里，即使您有一个看起来像应该是
there and even though you have a
something that looks like it should be a

393
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,460
半填充禁令您仍然拥有称为Mott绝缘子的绝缘子
half-filled ban you still have an
insulator known as a Mott insulator so

394
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:31,190
这与我们将要允许自己打开的物理学完全相同
this is exactly the same physics we're
just going to allow ourselves to turn on

395
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,760
然后通过这种互动，您可以使它像我们想要的那样强大或像我们想要的那样脆弱
and off that interaction you make it as
strong as we want or as weak as we want

396
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,770
好吧，所以不太复杂看起来像一个非常简单的模型，但这又是其中之一
okay so not too complicated looks like a
very simple model but again it's one of

397
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,190
这些模型看起来很简单，但不是一维可解决的， 
these models it looks simple but it
isn't it's solvable in one dimension and

398
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,100
尽管有十万篇论文，对此一无所知
absolutely nothing is known about it
despite a hundred thousand papers

399
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,650
以更高的尺寸写在上面，好吧，也许不是绝对，但是，但是
written on it in higher dimensions okay
maybe not absolutely nothing but but but

400
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,530
没有我们想要的那么多，这就是为什么人们不断写论文的原因
not as much as we would like which is
why people keep writing papers about it

401
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:59,870
好吧，那么我们该如何对待这个第一件事呢？ 
okay so how do we treat this well first
thing we're going to do we're going to

402
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:07,040
按照以下形式编写此交互项，将其写为u over 
write this interaction term as in the
following form will write it as u over

403
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,970
四个，上下加减四个
four and up plus and down minus u over
four

404
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:20,890
和向上平方负n向上负n负平方，所以这只是一个标识
and up up squared minus n up minus n
down squared so that's just an identity

405
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:26,349
这很容易，我们没有做任何不同的事情
that's easy we haven't done anything
different here what we're going to do

406
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:31,300
现在是我们要使均值场近似均值场
now is we're going to make the mean
field approximation mean field which

407
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:35,859
表示字段总是以某种方式或其他方式表示您所处位置的平均值
mean field always somehow or other means
take something's average where you're

408
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:39,430
不允许通过取平均值和什么来做不正确的事情
not allowed to do something that's
incorrect by taking an average and what

409
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,280
我们要做的是，这是不正确的，因为我们要采取
we're going to do which is not quite
correct is we're going to take an

410
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,359
这些项的平均值，因此我们将取n的平均值加上n的最小值和
average of these terms so we're going to
take average of n up plus n down and

411
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:54,310
将其减去您的平方，平均得到n减去n的平均值，然后平方就可以了
square it minus you over for average of
n up minus n down and square it okay so

412
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,740
这是平均场近似值，或者是平均场的一种类型
that's the mean field approximation or
it's one type of mean field

413
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:00,010
我们将要使用的近似值，我们需要先查看它给我们带来的好处
approximation we're going to use and we
need to see what it gives us well first

414
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:04,119
在这所有学期中，平均n个提出请求的发送总数
of all this term here average of n up
put send down that's just a total

415
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:13,000
密度电子的总密度总密度是固定的
density total number of electrons total
density and that's fixed probably fixed

416
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,090
在一天的开始，根据您所拥有的条件， 
at the beginning of the day by the
conditions that you have so that's just

417
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:19,060
要给第一个名词要给我们一个常数
going to give that first term is going
to give us a constant the interesting

418
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,230
这是这个名词的意思-结束实际上是每个站点的时刻
thing is this term here that ennop - end
down is actually the moment per site

419
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:31,150
除以玻尔磁子，然后取平方，所以减去u 
divided by the Bohr Magneton and then
it's gets squared so minus u over for a

420
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:34,150
瞬间除以Bohr Magneton平方，因为
moment divided by the Bohr Magneton
square right because the number of

421
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:39,640
分拆产生的旋转可能是网站上的磁矩，所以我们
spin-offs might have spin downs is the
magnetic moment on the site okay so we

422
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,880
可以重写这个交互项是一些我们不感兴趣的常数
can rewrite this interaction term is
some constant which we're not interested

423
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,010
减去你的四分之一，然后我将这一刻重写为磁化强度
in minus u over four and then I'm going
to rewrite this moment as magnetization

424
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:55,119
乘以单位B的面积乘以mu B平方，因此V等于单位体积
times the volume of the unit cell over
mu B squared so V equals volume of unit

425
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,940
单元格，之所以这样重写，是因为我想拥有
cell and the reason I'm rewriting it
that way is because I'd like to have

426
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,170
这东西作为磁化和磁化具有矩量
this thing as a magnetization and
magnetization has dimensions of moment

427
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,830
每单位体积，所以我必须放入单位体积的体积
per unit volume so I have to put in a
the volume of unit cell to have the

428
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,450
尺寸出来正确没关系，需要注意的是
dimensions come out right okay and the
thing to notice about this is that the

429
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,530
能量随着磁化强度变大，相互作用能变小
energy the interaction energy gets
smaller as the magnetization gets larger

430
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:23,320
为什么那么直觉实际上
why is that
well the intuition for that actually

431
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,869
如果所有自旋都在其他位置对齐，则来自保利排除原则
comes from the Pauli exclusion principle
if all the spins were aligned in other

432
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:32,290
如果磁化强度最大，那么就不会有相互作用
words if the magnetization were maximum
then there would be no interaction

433
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,220
能量，因为你永远不会有两个电子坐着的情况
energy whatsoever because you can never
have a situation where two electrons sat

434
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,460
在同一站点上，您仅需在有
on the same site and you only have to
pay this energy penalty when there are

435
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,420
同一位置上的两个电子，因此，如果您在同一位置极化所有自旋
two electrons on the same site so if you
polarize all your spins in the same

436
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,530
方向，您将获得尽可能小的交互能量，这就是为什么
direction you get the minimum possible
interaction energy and that's why it is

437
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:51,760
如果增加磁化强度，则下降的相互作用能是
if you increase the magnetization you
drop the interaction energy is that

438
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
清除好，好吧，从这张照片来看
clear
good all right so from this picture it

439
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,460
让您认为然后就可以了，一旦您打开了所有自旋的互动
makes you think then okay once you turn
on the interaction all the spins want to

440
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,150
对齐，但这并不容易，因为对齐旋转会降低您的动力
align but it's not so easy because
aligning the spins cost you kinetic

441
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,470
能量，你必须要让这两件事与之抗争
energy and you have to you have to sort
of let these two things fight it out

442
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:12,160
彼此，所以让我们提醒自己动力学发生了什么
with each other so let's remind
ourselves what happens to the kinetic

443
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,000
能量随着您改变系统的磁体而变化我们现在已经研究过了
energy as you change the magnet of a
system now we studied this before so if

444
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:33,060
您还记得我们在第一周保利·帕拉磁铁所做的保罗顺磁性
you recall pauli paramagnetism which we
did in the first week Pauli para magnet

445
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,060
旋转状态与能量状态的关系，看起来像这样，然后我们有
of states of spin up versus energy it
kind of looks like this and then we have

446
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:42,609
我们向下旋转的状态密度与能量的关系， 
the density of states we spin down
versus energy and it looks exactly the

447
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:49,000
一样，如果没有磁化，则将它们填充到同一水平
same and if there's no magnetization you
fill them both up to the same level this

448
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,950
听起来对Polly磁力很熟悉
sounds familiar from Polly power
magnetism

449
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,390
现在，如果您想使它们看起来应该相同，如果您想
now if you want to make those are
supposed to look identical if you want

450
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,349
拥有非零磁化强度，您需要做的是
to have a nonzero magnetization what you
have to do is you have to take some of

451
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:03,190
旋转并使其旋转，为此，我们将其中的一小部分
the spin downs and make them spin ups so
to do that let's take a sliver of these

452
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,770
旋转下来，我们必须将它们向上移动到更高的能量，所以这会花费您
spin downs and we have to move them up
to higher energy up here so it costs you

453
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:14,440
能量，所以这些应该对齐，所以要花费您精力
energy so these were supposed to be
aligned that so it costs you energy to

454
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,349
磁化强度不为零，动能消耗为非零
have a non zero magnetization it cost
you kinetic energy to have a non zero

455
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:22,810
磁化还可以，所以我们节省了一些相互作用能，但是却消耗了动力学
magnetization alright so we saved some
interaction energy but it cost kinetic

456
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:26,050
能量，所以我们必须权衡这些，以便计算
energy so we have to trade those off
against each other so in order to figure

457
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,310
要弄清楚这些是如何相互对抗的，我们必须弄清楚它们之间有多少
out how those are battle against each
other we have to figure out how much

458
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:33,880
能量实际上会花费您一些非零磁化强度，所以让我们
energy it actually costs you to have
some nonzero magnetization so let's do

459
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,020
所以首先我们要回到保利
that
so first we'll go back to the Pauli

460
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,270
功率磁计算，我们将为您设置
power magnetic calculation so we're
going to set you

461
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,840
零秒，所以现在我们回到非相互作用的电子，我是
to zero for a second so now we're back
to non-interacting electrons and I'm

462
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,070
将要写出的自由能是磁化强度的函数
going to write the free energy as a
function of magnetization as a function

463
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:54,340
单位体积的磁化强度，那么负m点BI会认为
magnetization per unit volume and that
will then the minus m dot B I think

464
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,030
每个人都可能会接受应该有一个这样的术语
everyone's probably will accept that
that's there should be a term like that

465
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:02,140
想要使磁化强度与自由能减m点B一致
in the free energy minus m dot B that
wants the magnetization to align with

466
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,550
与外部磁场，但第二项不那么明显，但
the with the external magnetic field but
then the second term is less obvious but

467
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:13,120
它采用M Squared mu形式，比Pauli磁化率高2倍
it takes the form M Squared mu naught
over 2 times the Pauli susceptibility

468
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:18,100
保利强力磁化率，我只想提醒您我们已经计算了
Pauli power magnetic susceptibility and
I'll just remind you we calculated this

469
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:26,110
在科德·保利（Paul Paul）嗨的学期的第一周，波莉（Polly）是喵
in the in the first week of the term
that cod Pauli was hi Polly is Mew

470
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,900
零μB平方乘以费米能量处的态密度就可以做到
naught mu B squared times the density of
states at the Fermi energy does that

471
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,040
听起来有点熟悉，现在我为什么写下来
kind of sound familiar
ok now why is it that I wrote down this

472
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,660
这里的术语比较复杂，为什么我认为这首先是正确的
complicated terms here why do I think
this is correct well first of all this

473
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,530
是磁化过程中的泰勒膨胀，所以在
is sort of a Taylor expansion in the
magnetization so this is linear in

474
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:47,560
磁化原理上存在二次方
magnetization there's a quadratic in
magnetization in principle there would

475
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,320
以及更高的术语，我们将忽略，因为我们有兴趣
be higher terms as well which we're
going to ignore because we're interested

476
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:55,180
通常以小磁化强度x'表示，但是为什么我不给这个名词
in small magnetization x' in general but
why would I give it this term mu naught

477
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,460
超过2个奇保利井，事实证明，它实际上必须具有这种形式，并且
over 2 Chi Pauli well it turns out that
it actually has to have this form and to

478
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,730
看到它必须具有这种形式，我们知道自由能应该是
see that it has to have this form we
know that the free energy should be

479
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:09,340
应该最小化，以便FDM必须等于零，并且
should be minimized
so the FDM has to equal zero and that

480
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:17,170
告诉我在R Chi Polly上减去的负B加M mu必须等于零，并且
tells me that minus B plus M mu naught
over R Chi Polly has to equal zero and

481
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:24,160
如果您只是重新排列，那就告诉我磁化作用是奇保利
if you just rearrange that that tells me
that the magnetization is Chi Pauli over

482
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,470
零倍磁场定义了奇保利
mu naught times the magnetic field which
is what defines Chi Pauli

483
00:43:29,470 --> 00:43:33,190
保利对我们的自由电子气的敏感性的定义
the definition of the Pauli
susceptibility for our free electron gas

484
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,390
磁化强度应该是Kuip oli乘以磁场，从而表明
is the magnetization should be Kuip oli
times the magnetic field so that tells

485
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:40,960
我的自由能量必须具有我刚刚写下的形式
me the free energy has to have that form
that I just wrote down ok

486
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,970
这可能是您可能会经历的痛苦中的一招
it's a little bit of a trick you could
go through the agony of trying to

487
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,720
实际计算磁化强度能量是磁化强度的函数
actually calculate the magnetization the
energy is a function of magnetization

488
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,380
您会得到相同的结果，您会发现它必须以这种方式出现
you get the same result you would
discover it has to come out this way

489
00:43:53,380 --> 00:44:01,270
好的，所以让我们关闭set set，将外部字段set B设为零
okay so so then let's turn off set set
the external field set B equal to zero

490
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:09,000
然后打开你不等于零的能量，那么我们得到的自由能是
and turn turn you on you not equal to
zero and then the free energy we get is

491
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,050
将是我们刚刚计算出的两个条件的组合
going to be a combination of the two
terms that we just calculated so free

492
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:20,650
那么每单位体积的能量就可以了，我们在这里将其关闭B，所以我
energy per volume is then well okay we
have this term here it turned off B so I

493
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:29,800
只是让M平方数变成了CAI poly的零，然后也要滚动
just get M squared nu naught over to CAI
poly but then also just about to scroll

494
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,620
顶上的减号是您的四倍
off the top
there's minus u over four times well

495
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:43,690
好的d覆盖在mu b平方的DZ平方的子像素上，我将得到
okay d squared over mu b squared DZ
squared of subdennis I'm going to get

496
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:47,350
除去V磁化强度的平方好，什么是V平方，但现在它将
rid of a V magnetization squared okay
what is V squared but now it's going to

497
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:51,250
是V，因为我写的是每单位体积的自由能，而不是
be V because I'm writing the free energy
per unit volume not the free energy in

498
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:55,900
这种情况好吧，所以我掉了一个体积的因子，所以这些正方形不他妈的
this case okay so I dropped a factor of
a volume so it's not these squares

499
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:03,220
是V好吧，我想这是可以排除M的原因，所以我们有M 
is V alright so what this is I guess we
can factor out the M so we have M

500
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:13,560
平方，然后超过2个chi poly-您通过mu B平方超过4 V 
squared and then u naught over 2 chi
poly - you over 4 V over mu B squared

501
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:19,090
这告诉我们，会有更高的术语两个术语是
and this tells us and there will be
higher terms two terms which are

502
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:23,440
四分之一的磁化强度，等等
quartered akin in magnetization and so
forth which are not interested in but

503
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,790
这里要意识到的关键是括号中的这个值是否小于0 
the key thing to realize here is if this
thing in the brackets is less than 0

504
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,340
那么磁化强度就想不为零
then the magnetization wants to be
nonzero

505
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:33,700
如果方括号中的东西大于0，那么磁化强度在哪里
where is if the thing in the brackets is
greater than 0 then the magnetization

506
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:44,920
想要设为0还好，那么这个准则就是法罗铁磁性的准则
wants to be 0 okay so the criterion so
criterion for ferromagnetism for farro

507
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:57,430
被称为斯托纳准则斯托纳准则是
which is known as the stoner criterion
stoner criterion is that this mu naught

508
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:04,990
超过2个Chi Poli-您的单位晶胞体积超过
over 2 Chi Poli - you volume of the unit
cell over

509
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:09,580
或玻尔磁子平方应小于零，因此当您打开
or bohr magneton squared should be less
than zero so when you turn on the

510
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:13,960
相互作用强度足够强，则相互作用强度就可以胜出
interaction strength strong enough then
the interaction strength wins and it

511
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,400
想要使自旋极化两极分化，而如果相互作用不强
wants to have this the spins polarize
whereas if the interaction is not strong

512
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,810
足够多，那么实际上具有相同数量的旋转和
enough then in fact it's more beneficial
to have an equal number of spin ups and

513
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,020
降低转速，因为您实际上可以这样节省动能
spin downs because you save kinetic
energy that way way actually we can

514
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,680
只需在Kai Poly的定义中将其重写即可
rewrite this in a just putting in the
definition of Kai poly we can write this

515
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:37,440
因为单位单元的体积乘以u乘以G的TF应该大于2 
as volume of the unit cell times u times
G a TF should be greater than two

516
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:44,619
等价的好，所以这就是我们从
equivalent okay so that's what we get
out of this mean field approximation for

517
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,730
弄清楚什么时候我们有铁磁性，但是有趣的事情之一
figuring out when we have ferromagnetism
but one of the things that's interesting

518
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:54,369
关于哈伯模型，您还可以获得哈伯反铁磁性哈伯
about the hubbard model is you can also
get a hubbard antiferromagnetism hubbard

519
00:46:54,369 --> 00:47:07,780
反铁磁性反铁磁性，当我们使用大的U 
anti ferromagnetism anti ferromagnetism
and this occurs when we have use large u

520
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:15,430
每个位点有一个大的电子，因此处于Mott绝缘体状态Mott 
large and one electron per site so this
is in the Mott insulator regime Mott

521
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:21,270
绝缘体，因此，如果u大，则可以防止每个位置有两个电子
insulator so if u is large it prevents
you from having two electrons per site

522
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:27,550
或基本上可以防止这种情况，然后由于每个位点只有一个电子，因此
or mostly prevents that and then since
it's one electron per site you have this

523
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:31,690
电子的交通阻塞，您在每个位置上只有一个电子
traffic jam of electrons where you have
exactly one electron on every site and

524
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,050
说服自己这件事将成为我们阿姨的方式
the way to convince yourself that this
thing is going to be an auntie for our

525
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:39,940
磁铁是要尝试两种可能性，因此一种情况是考虑使用铁磁体
magnet is to try the two possibilities
so case one it is consider a ferromagnet

526
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:47,550
情况一被认为是铁磁体达拉磁体，所以我们有很多自旋
case one is considered a ferromagnet
daraa magnet so we have a bunch of spins

527
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,880
每个电子都带有自旋，它们位于每个位置，它们都对齐，并且
electrons each with their spin sitting
on each site they're all aligned and the

528
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,740
这种情况下的能量实际上为零基态的能量为
energy of this situation is actually
zero the energy of the ground state is

529
00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:02,560
正好为零，而零为零的原因则是您永远无需支付任何互动
is exactly zero and the reason it's zero
is well you never pay any interaction

530
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,580
能量，因为根据泡利原理，没有电子坐在同一位置
energy because due to the Pauli
principle no electrons sit on the same

531
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:11,560
网站，所以您永远不必支付多晶硅价格，也不必支付u能源
site ever so you don't ever pay the poly
price you don't ever pay the u energy

532
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,510
而且电子根本不能从一个位置跳到另一个位置，因为
and also the electrons can't hop from
one site to the other at all because

533
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,560
交通堵塞，所以他们不能跳，所以
there's in the
traffic jam so they can't hop so the

534
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,790
跳跃的总能量现在也为零第二种可能性是
total energy of hopping is also zero
now the second possibility is that you

535
00:48:23,790 --> 00:48:29,460
有一个反铁磁体的盒子可以放我们的磁体，这还多了一点
have an antiferromagnet case to ante for
our magnet and this is a little more

536
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:36,410
之所以复杂，是因为我们已经降低了速度，降低了速度，等等
complicated because we have spin up spin
down spin up spin down and so forth and

537
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:39,990
在这里，电子可以跳到
here
well an electron can hop to the

538
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,910
相邻站点，但必须为此付出一定的代价，这样您就可以旋转
neighboring site but it has to it has to
pay a price to do so so you'll get spin

539
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,450
向上旋转，您在这一侧将有0，然后在此侧，您将具有上下
up spin down you'll have 0 on this side
and then you have up-down on this side

540
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,460
它消耗了你的能量U，然后又在这边上升，所以这是一个兴奋的状态
which cost you energy U and then up on
this side so this is an excited state

541
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:57,720
这是一个有效的兴奋状态，可能会消耗一些能量，因此您可能会很大
which is a valid excited state it costs
you some energy you you might be large

542
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,680
但至少实际上你可以做这样的事情，所以二阶
but at least virtually you can make such
a thing and so in second-order

543
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,000
扰动理论由于这种跳跃过程，您在
perturbation Theory due to this sort of
hopping process you get a shift in the

544
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,770
所有可能的激发x'激发跳变之和的能量
energy which is sum over all possible
excitation x' excitation hopping

545
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:18,870
哈密​​尔顿基态平方于能量0减去能量激发态
hamiltonian ground state squared over
energy 0 minus energy excited state and

546
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:24,560
这小于0，所以实际上能量变化小于0，所以
this is less than 0 so in fact the
change in energy is less than 0 so

547
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,410
反铁磁的反铁磁能量小于一个
antiferromagnetic energy for
antiferromagnet is less than energy of a

548
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:38,750
当您在此莫特绝缘子中每个位点有一个电子时，铁磁体
ferromagnet when you have one electron
per site in this in this Mott insulator

549
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:43,020
现在限制，这似乎有点复杂，但让我改写一下
limit now this might seem a little
complicated but let me rephrase what we

550
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:48,900
如果您有铁磁体，那么就做，所以在铁磁体的情况下，每个电子
just did if you have a ferromagnet so in
the case of a ferromagnet each electron

551
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:53,310
基本上坐在一个无限高的井里，你不能跳到左边
is basically sitting in an infinitely
tall well you can't hop to the left it

552
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:56,040
不能跳到Pauli排除绝对禁止的右边
can't hop to the right that's absolutely
forbidden by the Pauli exclusion

553
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,190
原理，所以您应该将其视为无限地存在的电子
principle so you should think of it as
an electron sitting in the infinitely

554
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:08,550
高的井，而对于反铁磁体，您在有限的井中有一个电子
tall well whereas for an antiferromagnet
you have an electron in a finite well so

555
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,690
井的高度只有您自己，它可以跳至所需的邻近站点
the height of the well is only you it
can hop to the neighboring site it costs

556
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:17,790
能量u但它可以做到，但Pauli和
an energy u but it can do it it's not
forbidden by Pauli and the energy of the

557
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,930
具有有限势垒的反铁磁体比铁磁体的能量低
antiferromagnet with a finite barrier is
lower than the energy of the ferromagnet

558
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:26,310
具有无限的障碍，因此反铁磁体受到青睐，所以这是
with the infinite barrier so the
antiferromagnet is favored so this is

559
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:30,810
某种原因使反铁磁性有点，所以它使
sort of one of the things that makes the
anti ferromagnetism a little so it makes

560
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:33,200
哈伯德模型很有趣，它可以给你
the hubbard model
quite interesting that it can give you

561
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,469
反铁磁性它可以给您铁磁性它可以给您很多
anti ferromagnetism it can give you
ferrimagnetism it can give you lots of

562
00:50:36,469 --> 00:50:39,380
其他物理学，包括超导电荷密度波
other physics as well including
superconductivity charge density waves

563
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,410
还有各种各样的其他事情，这就是为什么有十万
and all sorts of other things which is
why there's been a hundred thousand

564
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:46,549
用这种哈伯德模型写的论文，你不为我所有的一切负责
papers written on this hubbard model
you're not responsible for all of that i

565
00:50:46,549 --> 00:50:49,489
保证您应该了解流动铁磁性
promise you're supposed to know
something about itinerant ferromagnetism

566
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:55,880
但是没关系，所以请坐着不动，我们将继续本讲座，因为我们
but that's all okay so sit still we're
gonna go over on this lecture because we

567
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:58,430
实际上已经结束了课程，所以我只想包装所有内容
actually have come to the end of the
course so I just want to wrap everything

568
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:03,049
我们要取消明天的讲座这实际上是按计划进行的
up we're gonna cancel tomorrow's lecture
this is this is actually on schedule we

569
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:06,049
实际上是计划要举行的二十一次讲座，但我会多留一点
is it's actually planned to be twenty
one lectures but I leave an extra

570
00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:09,890
在发生灾难或落后时进行演讲，我们没有落后，我们做了
lecture in case of disasters or running
behind and we didn't run behind we did

571
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:14,569
一切都按计划进行，因此我们实际上已经完成了该课程，或者
everything exactly as planned so we have
actually finished the course more or

572
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:19,700
在结束之前，少一些组织评论
less a couple of sort of organizational
comments before before the closing

573
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:22,519
首先显然没有演讲
remarks
first of all obviously no lecture

574
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:28,160
明天，这是第一条评论，第二条评论是您知道还是不知道
tomorrow that's the first comment the
second comment is you know one or not

575
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,249
知道一个，但很少有人实际使用此留言板
know one but very few people actually
use the message board heavily this this

576
00:51:31,249 --> 00:51:35,479
这个词没关系，我不知道为什么这是人们不喜欢的，那没关系
term that's okay I don't know why it is
people didn't like it that's that's fine

577
00:51:35,479 --> 00:51:39,829
但您知道此留言板仍在运行，我想随着它的到来
but you know this message board is still
up and running and I think as it gets

578
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:42,979
靠近考试的人们会更热衷于使用它并询问
closer to exams people will get more
enthusiastic about using it and asking

579
00:51:42,979 --> 00:51:46,130
很好的问题就是要在那里存在，所以不要
questions that's fine that's what it's
meant that to be there for so don't

580
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:49,549
犹豫使用它向您的心脏的内容提出问题，我将尝试回答
hesitate to use it ask questions to your
heart's content I will try to answer as

581
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:54,170
当您为考试修改时，我会尽可能多地选择我想要的另一件事
many of them as I can as you revise for
your exams the other thing that I want

582
00:51:54,170 --> 00:52:00,049
问您要做的是让我知道您想要的修订讲座内容
to ask you to do is let me know what you
want to have for the revision lectures

583
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:04,009
我们必须在三位一体任期的第四周修订讲座， 
we have to revision lectures in the
fourth week of Trinity term and I'm

584
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:07,640
最无聊的事情总是完全不知所措
always completely at a loss as to what
the most useful thing to talk about is

585
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,569
如果您认为我应该尝试给出一个概述，那么您可以
if you think I should try to just give
an overview to do that if you there are

586
00:52:11,569 --> 00:52:14,930
您想从上一年的考试中得到的特定问题
particular questions from that from
previous year's exams that you want to

587
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,209
走过去，让我知道我会尝试组装一些人们会觉得有用的东西
go over let me know I'll try to assemble
something that people will find useful

588
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:24,319
好了，所以当我们开始的时候，课程的一些总结性想法
alright so just a couple of closing
ideas for the course when we started

589
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:29,150
七个半星期前，我向我保证，到课程结束时
seven and a half weeks ago I promised
that that by the end of the course we'd

590
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:32,329
其实对我们周围的世界了解得更多，我认为我们
actually know something more about the
the world around us and I think we

591
00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:36,289
我们真的知道像您这样的事情吗，为什么钻石透明并且
genuinely do we know things like you
know why diamonds transparent and and

592
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:40,969
为什么要熨磁铁，为什么固体会在较高温度下膨胀，还有很多
why irons a magnet and why solids expand
at higher temperature and and many many

593
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:44,359
更多的东西，其中有些非常深奥，而有些则不那么深奥
more things and some of them very
esoteric and some of them less esoteric

594
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:47,789
诸如量子量子效应之类的东西对热很重要
things like quantum
quantum effects are important for heat

595
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:51,839
容量或晶体管的工作方式，以及如何确定晶体
capacity or how it transistor works and
and how you determine the crystal

596
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,009
我希望为从事科学工作的人们提供X射线材料的结构
structure of a material in x-ray for
those of you who go on in science I hope

597
00:52:56,009 --> 00:53:00,239
这为将来的学习和发现更多内容奠定了良好的基础
this forms a good foundation for for
future learning and discovering more

598
00:53:00,239 --> 00:53:03,989
沿着相同的路线，甚至在其他领域中的事物， 
things along the same lines or even in
other fields for those of you don't go

599
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:08,219
进入科学领域，你知道那也很好，我希望至少是
on into science that's you know that's
fine too I hope that's at least been a

600
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:12,930
对自然世界的美好而有趣的探索，我希望它能使您离开
good and entertaining exploration of the
natural world and I hope it leaves you

601
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:17,549
至少我对主题有了更好的理解
with a better appreciation for the
subject at the very least I do realize

602
00:53:17,549 --> 00:53:20,969
本课程内容很多，对此我深表歉意
that there's an awful lot of material in
this course and I apologize about that

603
00:53:20,969 --> 00:53:26,039
考试或多或少地固定了一定数量的材料
it was more or less a fixed amount of
material fixed by the exams the exam

604
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:30,150
委员会和课程提纲，所以我们实际上没有那么多的自由删除权
committee and the syllabus so we don't
really have that much freedom to remove

605
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:34,140
因此我意识到很多人认为这是从
material so I realized that a lot of
people view this as drinking from a

606
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,710
你知道，只有这么多的信息才会来袭你
firehose you know it's just so much
information coming you coming at you at

607
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:42,930
同时很难吸收，但具有讽刺意味的是，最大的问题是
the same time it's hard to absorb but
ironically the the biggest problem with

608
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:46,499
当然，实际上里面没有足够的东西，我不是说
the course is that there's actually not
enough in it and not I don't say that

609
00:53:46,499 --> 00:53:49,469
因为我觉得您需要为考试学习更多的知识，所以我说是因为
because I feel like you need to learn
more for your exams I say that because

610
00:53:49,469 --> 00:53:53,369
凝聚态物质是一个巨大的主题，以至于我们和我们几乎都没有
condensed matter is such an enormous
subject that it we and we've hardly

611
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:57,180
划伤表面似乎把它留在这里真可惜，但这就是全部
scratched the surface it seems such a
shame to leave it here but this is all

612
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:02,670
我们有时间可以轻松地进行为期一年或更长时间的材料讲座
we have time for we could easily do a
year of lectures or more on material

613
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:06,719
物理或量子效应或统计效应或设备物理或
physics or quantum effects or
statistical effects or device physics or

614
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:12,119
我们根本没有提到的十几种事物中的任何一种
any one of a dozen types of things that
we just barely mentioned at all and as

615
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:15,479
以及许多我们甚至没有涉及到的超导体超流体
well as many many things that we didn't
even get to superconductors superfluids

616
00:54:15,479 --> 00:54:19,829
等等，我希望我真的希望你们中的许多人有
fractionalized particles so forth and so
on I hope I really hope many of you have

617
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:24,359
将来有机会继续学习这些东西的机会
the opportunity to go on and learn about
those things in the future and hopefully

618
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:27,539
它将会像您学到的一样有趣，甚至更有趣
it will be as entertaining or even more
entertaining as what you've learned so

619
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,890
最后，我只想感谢大家参加讲座和
far finally I just want to thank you all
for having come to lectures and having

620
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:36,559
整个学期看起来都很热情，非常感谢
looked enthusiastic throughout the term
thank you very much

621
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,320
您
you
