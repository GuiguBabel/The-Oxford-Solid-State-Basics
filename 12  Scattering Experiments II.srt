1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,529
好吧，让我们开始吧，欢迎回来，这是第十二个
okay let's get started
welcome back it's the this is the 12th

2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:14,840
浓缩物课程的讲座你好，还是星期一，所以当我们离开时
lecture of the condensed matter course
hello is it Monday still so when we left

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:18,350
我们谈论的是散射标准散射实验
off we were talking about scattering the
standard scattering experiment did you

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,990
有一些样本在波矢K处发送一些波，然后出现一些东西
have some sample you send in some wave
at wave vector K and something comes out

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:30,320
和波向量K Prime并通过测量在各种波向量K处产生的结果
and wave vector K Prime and by measuring
what comes out at various wave vectors K

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,500
首要的，我们应该能够从微观上推断出结构
Prime we're supposed to be able to
deduce the structure the microscopic

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,730
样本的结构，我想再次强调一下， 
structure of the sample and I want to
emphasize again that this type of

8
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,470
实验是理解事物微观结构的方式
experiment is the way to understand the
microscopic structures of things on

9
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,280
规模小于您实际能看到的诺贝尔奖数量
scales smaller than you can actually see
with your eye the number of Nobel Prizes

10
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,730
进行此类实验的人获得的奖励是巨大的
that have been awarded for people doing
this type of experiment is enormous

11
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:54,710
大概有20 25 30个无知的奖品
there's like 20 25 30 ignoble prizes
just a couple of famous ones you know

12
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,880
牛津大学的多萝西·霍奇金·萨默维尔最喜欢的女儿赢得了
Oxford's own Dorothy Hodgkin
Somerville's favorite daughter won a

13
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,110
发现青霉素和胰岛素的结构获得诺贝尔奖
Nobel Prize for discovering the
structure of penicillin and insulin

14
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:07,579
使用X射线散射，沃森和克里克（Watson and Crick）非常著名地发现了DNA的两倍
using x-ray scattering Watson and Crick
very famously figured out the DNA double

15
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:11,810
他们通过查看X射线散射数据得出的螺旋结构
helix structure which they figured out
by looking at x-ray scattering data

16
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,159
罗莎琳德·富兰克林（Rosalind Franklin）摄Russell Franklin不幸去世， 
taken by rosalind Franklin Russell
Franklin sadly died extremely young and

17
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,710
因此，她被剥夺了诺贝尔奖以及她的余生
was therefore denied a Nobel Prize as
well as the rest of her life just very

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,630
伤心，但每个人都应该知道她的名字
sad but everyone should know her name
nonetheless anyway this is an extremely

19
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,689
重要的实验，这就是为什么我们要花很多时间在
important experiment and that's why
we're spending so much time on it at

20
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:32,990
至少是本讲座的下一个讲座，也许是之后的一些讲座
least this lecture next lecture and
maybe some of the lecture there after

21
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,170
我们在上一堂课中得出的一件事是，为了获得
one of the things we derived in the last
lecture is that in order to get

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,439
从k到k素数的散射，我们必须在晶体中满足老挝条件
scattering from k to k prime we must
satisfy in a crystal the lao e condition

23
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:47,780
 K减去K素数现在必须是倒数晶格向量G 
that K minus K prime must be a
reciprocal lattice vector G now at the

24
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,819
在上一堂课结束时，我声称这种情况很糟糕
very end of last lecture I claimed that
this condition this lousy condition is

25
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:58,189
与您在考虑时已经考虑过的情况非常相似
very similar to a condition that you
have already thought about when you

26
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:06,079
被认为只是平面上的简单衍射，您拥有光或X射线，或者
considered just simple diffraction off
of planes you have light or x-rays or

27
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,889
进入一组平行平面的东西或中子
something or neutrons coming into a set
of parallel planes a family of lattice

28
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:15,200
平面和您有不同，我们了解如何获得衍射
planes and you have different you we
understand how you can get diffraction

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,610
这种类型与平行的
of this sort at
certain angles off of parallel family of

30
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,450
飞机，我要说这种情况实际上是
planes and I'm gonna claim that this
this condition here is actually

31
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,360
等价于此，所以我们首先要做的是回顾一些
equivalent to that so first what we're
gonna do is we're going to review some

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,320
关于平面衍射的事情，那么我们将证明糟糕的是
things about diffraction off of planes
then we're gonna show that the lousy

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,970
条件和衍射条件是相同的，所以让我们抽象一下
condition and the diffraction conditions
are the same so let's uh abstract this

34
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,750
像这样在一组飞机上拍一些照片，想像一下我们
picture a little bit to just a set of
planes like this and well imagine we

35
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:49,090
像这样有波进来，它像这样以角度θ反射
have some wave coming in like this it
reflects off like this at an angle theta

36
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,160
而且还有另外一个平行波像这样完全一样的波
but also another parallel wave coming in
like this exactly the same wave just

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:01,400
下降到一层，像这样以相同的角度θ进一步衍射
goes down to one layer further diffract
off like this the same angle theta like

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,880
这个，我要去强调，我也许可以
this and I'm just going I'm going to
actually emphasize this I may be able to

39
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,770
甚至将其写下来，因为它是错误总数的极为常见的来源
even write it down because it's an
extremely common source of error total

40
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:19,550
偏转角偏转角等于theta为什么为什么有theta 
deflection angle deflection angle equals
to theta why is that well there's theta

41
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,360
那里还有另一个θ，所以角度差
there and another theta there so the
difference the difference in angle

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,310
传入波和传出波之间实际上是两个theta 
between the incoming wave and the
outcoming wave is actually two theta you

43
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,820
知道这会给很多人带来各种各样的悲伤，所以请确保
know that this this causes all sorts of
grief to a lot of people so make sure

44
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,220
你知道什么时候你在谈论theta以及你在谈论两个theta 
you know when you're talking about theta
and what are you talking about two theta

45
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:39,500
因此，当您在前几年进行这种类型的计算时，您知道
so as you did this this type of
calculation in prior years you know that

46
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,560
您需要做的是计算额外距离
the what you need to do is you need to
calculate the additional distance

47
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,160
由第二波传播，所以如果我在此处垂直放置
traveled by the second wave so if I drop
a perpendicular here and a perpendicular

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:55,970
如果D是两者之间的距离，则此处的附加距离为d正弦角
here the additional distance here is d
sine theta if D is the distance between

49
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:02,450
因此，为了获得相长干涉
the the layers so in order to get
constructive interference constructive

50
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:09,220
哦，也许我先写这个额外距离
oh maybe maybe I'll write this first the
additional distance additional distance

51
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:18,560
距离等于2 D正弦theta等于2 D正弦theta所以它是D正弦theta 
distance is then 2 D sine theta equals 2
D sine theta so it's D sine theta on

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,910
在这边，然后在那边再有一个D正弦θ，因此额外的距离
this side and then another D sine theta
on that side so the additional distance

53
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,860
由第二平面反射回来的波所取的是2 D正弦θ2 
taken by the by the wave that reflected
off the second plane is 2 D sine theta 2

54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,440
建设性干涉建设性干涉
constructive interference constructive

55
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:42,990
干扰罐子的放屁我想这是我在写作中所说的
interference in jar farrance I think
it's as the term goes on my writing gets

56
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,610
更糟的是，我们得到的是n lambda等于两个正弦θ，因此您必须有一个整数
worse we get is n lambda equals two sine
theta so you have to have an integer

57
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:53,820
该额外距离中包含的波长数量看起来是否全部
number of wavelengths contained in that
extra distance does that all look

58
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,810
前几年很熟悉，是的，所以我要在它周围放一个盒子，因为它
familiar from previous years yeah okay
so I'll put a box around it because it's

59
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,100
一个重要的方程式称为布拉格条件布拉格条件
an important equation this is known as
the Bragg condition Bragg condition

60
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,260
继威廉·亨利和威廉·劳伦斯·布拉格父子团队之后
after William Henry and William Lawrence
Bragg the father-and-son team who

61
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,630
开创性的X射线散射William Lawrence Bragg在2006年获得了诺贝尔奖
pioneered x-ray scattering William
Lawrence Bragg winning a Nobel Prize at

62
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,730
 25岁的他对巧克力棒的X射线散射所做的工作
the age of 25 for his work on x-ray
scattering for a chocolate bar does

63
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,980
谁知道第二个最年轻的诺贝尔奖获得者是谁
anyone know who the second youngest
Nobel laureate was it's a name you all

64
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,910
知道这些都是真的很好的猜测，但是这些都是错误的，真的很接近
know those are all really good guesses
but those are all wrong really close to

65
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,210
他们都是同一个时代的海森堡，他们在那里说了哦，我的天哪足够近了，是的
all of them same era Heisenberg who said
it up there oh my gosh close enough yes

66
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,250
海森堡恰好是狄拉克（Dirac），当时年纪才几个月
Heisenberg exactly Dirac was just a few
months older well then then then

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:50,400
海森堡好吧，所以现在我向你宣称是这种情况
Heisenberg all right so now that when I
claim to you was that this condition

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,580
这种布拉德条件很活跃，却忘记了建设性干扰
this Brad condition is active forgetting
constructive interference

69
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,960
您只会从某些角度产生建设性干扰
you only get constructive interference
coming off on certain angles from your

70
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,660
水晶，那个状况实际上和这个糟糕的状况相同
crystal that that condition is actually
the same condition as this lousy

71
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,490
罐子的状况就是晶体动量的守恒
condition over here the can which is the
conservation of crystal momentum so

72
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:17,000
让我们看看是否可以证明将其写下来，因为这是等价的
let's see if we can prove that write
this down because this is a equivalence

73
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:31,200
布拉格抹布和哇哇好吧，同样的图，我们在一个家庭中有两个平行的平面
bragg rag and wowie okay so same diagram
we have two parallel planes in a family

74
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,140
晶格平面，您实际上可以有点理解为什么
of lattice plane you can actually you
can kind of understand why it is that

75
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,710
这两个将是相关的，请记住上一堂课
these two are going to be related
remember from last lecture that

76
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,040
倒易的晶格矢量与晶格族相关
reciprocal lattice vectors are
associated with families of lattice

77
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,110
飞机，所以gee会告诉你
planes so
gee up there is going to be telling you

78
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,860
关于这个晶格平面族的一些事实，我们拥有的事实
something about this family of lattice
planes so the the fact that we have

79
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,729
平行平面是因为我们有一个倒数的晶格矢量
parallel planes is because we have a
reciprocal lattice vector those are sort

80
00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:55,720
等价语句的集合，所以在这里我们将晶格平面族分开
of equivalent statements so here we have
our family of lattice planes separated

81
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:03,400
在一定距离D处，我们在波矢K处有一个入射波，并将其传出
by some distance D we have an incoming
wave at wave vector K and outgoing it

82
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,520
波向量K素，然后由于我们那里有一个晶格平面族
wave vector K Prime that and then since
we have a family of lattice planes there

83
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,740
是正交向量G，它是一个倒数的晶格向量
is a orthogonal vector G which is a
reciprocal lattice vector that was one

84
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,770
上一次衍生出来的东西，然后每次我们有一个家庭
of the things we derive last time then
every time we have a family of lavs

85
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:23,220
平面上有一个与其垂直的倒数晶格矢量，因为我们有
planes there's a reciprocal lattice
vector perpendicular to it since we have

86
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,669
因为我们有弹性散射K的大小和K的大小
since we have elastic scattering the
magnitude of K and the magnitude of K

87
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:35,610
质数是相同的，实际上定义了一些单位向量
Prime are the same and that's actually
define some unit vectors unit vectors of

88
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:43,449
 XK帽子K素色帽子和G帽子要适当的指向
X K hat K prime hat and G hat to be
pointing in the the appropriate

89
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:49,780
方向，然后有一点点几何形状K hat dot G hat equals正弦
directions and then with a little bit of
geometry K hat dot G hat equals sine

90
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:54,039
 theta只需花一秒钟，确保您确信如果k hat和g 
theta just take a second make sure
you're convinced of that if k hat and g

91
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:58,210
帽子指向同一方向，那么混乱的帽子将为1正弦θ 
hat were pointing in the same direction
then chaotic g hat would be 1 sine theta

92
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,310
在那种情况下也将是1而相反的K素数帽子
would also be 1 in that case whereas K
prime hat which is going in the opposite

93
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:10,930
方向G帽子是正弦减theta好的，我们也可以使用我们将需要的
direction G hat is minus sine theta okay
and we can also use we're gonna need

94
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:16,090
我们可以将K向量写为K的大小，即Lambda上的2 PI 
that that K vector we can write as the
magnitude of K which is 2 PI over lambda

95
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,039
 λ波长乘以K 
with lambda the wave vector with the
wavelength times K hat everyone happy

96
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,280
到目前为止，是的，很好，所以我们要假设处于低矮状态
with this so far yeah ok good so we're
gonna assume the lowry condition so

97
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:38,890
假设毛伊等于K减去K素数等于G，所以假设满足并且我
assume maui that is K minus K prime
equals G so assume that satisfied and I

98
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:45,180
可以重写为λ2乘以λ乘以K 
can rewrite that then as 2 PI over
lambda times K hat minus K prime hat

99
00:08:45,180 --> 00:09:02,110
等于G，然后用G帽子加点，以在λG帽子上得到2个PI。 
equals G then dot with G hat to get 2 PI
over lambda G hat dot k hat minus G hat

100
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:13,300
点k素数帽子等于G帽子点G向量好，那么我们将替换为
dot k prime hat equals G hat dot G
vector okay then we'll substitute in we

101
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,100
只是G帽子的点k帽子是正弦θ，所以我们将其替换为
just had the G hat dot k hat is sine
theta so we'll substitute that in so we

102
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,940
在lambda上获得2 PI，所以这是正弦θ在这里第二项是负正弦
get 2 PI over lambda so this is sine
theta here the second term is minus sine

103
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:31,350
 theta然后G hat G vector就是G vector的绝对值
theta and then G hat G vector is just
the absolute value of G vector

104
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:44,110
每个人都还开心，好吧，不，不开心，是啊，仍然开心，嗯，好，所以
everyone's still happy ok um no not
happy yeah still happy um okay so just a

105
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,529
一点点重排，这在绝对G向量乘以2正弦时变成2 PI 
little bit of rearrangement this becomes
2 PI over absolute G vector times 2 sine

106
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:57,010
 theta等于lambda，现在记住我们说的是上次导出的内容
theta equals lambda and now remember
what we said what we derived last time

107
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,620
关于互易的晶格矢量晶格平面D之间的间距为2 PI 
about reciprocal lattice vectors the
spacing between lattice planes D is 2 PI

108
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,350
在给定方向G min上最短的倒数晶格矢量上
over the shortest reciprocal lattice
vector in a given direction G min so any

109
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,649
倒数晶格向量G向量必须是最小值的整数倍
reciprocal lattice vector G vector has
to be some integer times the minimum

110
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:25,480
在给定方向上的晶格矢量，所以n是一些整数，所以
lattice vector in that given direction
so n is some integer integer so

111
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,190
将此等式中的等式代入上面的等式
substituting this equation in this
equation into the equation just above

112
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:36,850
给我们2个D正弦theta等于和lambda布拉格条件，所以我们已经
gives us 2 D sine theta equals and
lambda the Bragg condition so what we've

113
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,649
结果表明，在低e条件下，晶体动量守恒是
shown is that the low e condition this
conservation of crystal momentum is the

114
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:47,260
与需要建设性干涉或拥有布拉格一样
same thing as requiring constructive
interference or having the Bragg

115
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:53,540
条件满意还可以吧
condition satisfied ok good
all right so

116
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,290
假设我们有布拉格条件或优等条件
supposing that we have the Bragg
condition or the laude condition

117
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,580
我们上次得出的结论之一是
satisfied one of the things we derive
last time was that the intensity of

118
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,529
散射强度与结构强度成正比
scattering intensity of scattering is
proportional to the structure factor at

119
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:16,430
 GK减去K素数平方，结构因子s等于
G K minus K prime squared the structure
factor s equals the Fourier transform of

120
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,350
 EMR的散射潜能听起来像上一堂课一样
the scattering potential of EMR does
that sound familiar from last lecture I

121
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:33,390
希望还可以，但是问题仍然存在。 
hope ok but that still leaves up in the
question what is V of R and what V of R

122
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,760
波进入晶体时感觉到的潜力取决于
is what the potential your wave feels as
it goes into the crystal depends on well

123
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,399
取决于晶体，但也取决于您是哪种波
depends on the crystal but it also
depends on what kind of wave you're

124
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,029
使用您知道波与晶体的相互作用非常不同，取决于
using you know the wave interacts with
the crystal very differently depending

125
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:50,459
根据您使用的波形类型，因此更容易考虑的情况是
on the type of wave that you're using so
the easier case to think about is

126
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:55,850
中子所以案例1中子中子
neutrons so case 1 neutrons neutrons

127
00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:09,390
主要通过短程近程通过核力进行相互作用
interact mainly mainly via nuclear
forces by a short-range short-range

128
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:18,380
核力量和核力量
nuclear forces and nuclear forces

129
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:25,260
那么这意味着中子进入了样本，他们看到了
so what does that mean it means the
neutrons go into the sample and they see

130
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:30,510
与原子核相关的非常短程的电势，我们可以写出V 
very short-range potentials associated
with the nuclei and we can write the V

131
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:38,820
 R等于或正比于我猜所有原子的原子之和
of R equals or it's proportional to I
guess sum over atoms from all atoms

132
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,430
整个系统中的alpha系数为alpha乘以delta 
alpha in the whole system some
coefficient be alpha times a delta

133
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:52,079
 R减去R alpha的功能势，所以基本上说每个原子核
function potential at R minus R alpha so
basically saying that every nucleus so

134
00:12:52,079 --> 00:13:02,790
我们的alpha是原子alpha的位置，而alpha是在
our alpha is position of atom alpha
position of alpha and be alpha is in the

135
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,300
与该原子核相互作用的大小被称为核子
the magnitude of the interaction with
that nucleus it's known as the nuclear

136
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:21,570
散射长度散射长度，所以这个方程的本质是
scattering length scattering length and
so the essence of this equation is

137
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,399
基本上说，进入它们的中子看到了非常尖锐的峰值
basically saying that the the neutrons
coming in they see very sharp peaks in

138
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,010
在核位置的潜力，这就是他们所没有看到的
potential at the positions of the nuclei
and and that's all they don't see

139
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,510
现在其他任何这些系数，因为它们必须
anything else
now these coefficients be they have to

140
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,829
核物理学和核物理学可能非常复杂
do with nuclear physics and nuclear
physics can be extremely complicated

141
00:13:39,829 --> 00:13:43,500
根据具体情况，它们可以是正数或负数
they can be positive or they can be
negative depending on the particular

142
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,370
我们所说的正核意味着您具有排斥性相互作用
nucleus we're talking about positive
means you have a repulsive interaction

143
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,699
负核意味着您与
with the nucleus negative means you have
an attractive interaction with the

144
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:54,570
核，你也可以任一个，这些蜜蜂的大小可以变化，你知道
nucleus and you can either either and
the size of these bees can vary you know

145
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,170
取决于您正在考虑的特定原子核
by it Lots depending on the particular
nucleus you're thinking about and really

146
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,920
知道B对于特定原子核的唯一方法是只查找它
the only way to know what B is for a
particular nucleus is to just look it up

147
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,569
在桌子上或测量它，您知道周期中可能有两个原子
on a table or measure it you know you
could have two atoms on the periodic

148
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:10,140
彼此相邻的桌子，例如碳氮和核
table that are right next to each other
like carbon nitrogen and the nuclear

149
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,839
散射长度是完全不同的，你知道有些可以是正的
scattering lengths is completely
different you know some can be positive

150
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,110
有些可能是负面的，它到处都是，所以实际上是
some can be negative it just goes all
over the place so it's actually a

151
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,160
我们甚至无法真正预测核物理学家的东西
something that we can't actually predict
very easily even nuclear physicist even

152
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,139
好的核物理学家很难预测这些事情，所以我们只有
good nuclear physicists have a hard time
predicting these things so we just have

153
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:29,130
你知道诉诸表，并假设这些东西是已知的
to you know resort to a table and assume
that these things are known or this

154
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,880
以某种方式我们将能够测量它们，但是给定
somehow we're going to be able to
measure them but given

155
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,470
我们具有这种与核相互作用的功能形式
that we have this sort of functional
form of the interaction with the nuclei

156
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,980
然后我们可以计算G的结构因子s 
we can then calculate the structure
factor structure factor s of G which

157
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,340
记住定义是它实际上是dpr这是权威
remember the definition is that it's
actually dpr it's the authority

158
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,180
在单位单元中将e的单位单元中的傅立叶变换为I 
transform in the unit cell the fourier
transform in the unit cell of e to the I

159
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,030
 G点R乘以R的V 
G dot R times V of R something we
derived last time and if we actually

160
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:10,950
插入上面刚刚记下的表格，我们得出的总和超过了alpha 
plug in the the form that we just wrote
down above we have sum over alpha be

161
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:16,790
 Alpha Delta 3维Delta函数R减去R sub alpha现在我们将
Alpha Delta 3 dimensional Delta function
R minus R sub alpha now we'll let the

162
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,920
 Delta函数的作用，我们得到了相当简单的结果并总结了Adams 
Delta function act and we get the fairly
simple outcome and to sum over Adams

163
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:35,490
 V sub alpha e到IG点R sub alpha的晶胞中的alpha Adams alpha，其中
alpha Adams alpha in unit cell of V sub
alpha e to the I G dot R sub alpha where

164
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:46,020
 R sub alpha是原子alpha在晶胞alpha中的位置，因此
R sub alpha is the position of position
of atom alpha in unit cell alpha so

165
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:52,770
在那里，所以这是散射
there we have it so that's the structure
factor for scattering scattering of

166
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,520
现在中子对原子核是超级中子
neutrons against nuclei now that's for
super neutrons neutrons being fairly

167
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,630
很简单，但还有第二种情况，我们需要担心的是x射线和
simple but there's a second case that we
need to worry about which is x rays and

168
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:10,620
 X射线是更复杂的麦克射线X射线是电磁X射线
x-rays are more complicated mike rays x
rays well their electromagnetism x-rays

169
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,830
你知道吗，像光一样，它们主要散射，主要是电子散射
are you know like light they mainly
scatter mainly scatter from electrons

170
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:28,980
电子通过汤姆森从电子中散射
scatter from electrons from from
electrons electrons via Thomson

171
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,280
他去年研究了汤姆森散射，所以听起来很熟悉
scattering he studies Thomson scattering
last year so it sound familiar yeah so

172
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,220
他们通过汤普森散射从电子中散射出来，有一点点
they made a scattering from electrons
via Thompson scattering there's a little

173
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,520
汤姆森散布在原子核上，但实际上非常非常小
bit of Thomson scattering off the nuclei
but really very very very small amount

174
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,200
因为与电子相比，原子核非常重，所以它们
because the the nuclei are very heavy
compared to the electrons and so they're

175
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,520
很难散开，很难推开它们
very hard to scatter off of it's hard to
push them around

176
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,170
推电子很容易，因为它们很轻，所以主要是我们的V 
it's easy to push the electrons around
because they're light so mainly V of our

177
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:55,270
对于我们的X射线，有效相互作用与密度成正比
for our x-rays the effective interaction
is proportional to the density of

178
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:03,760
电子的电子密度，那么我们能得到的电子密度是多少
electrons density of electrons so what's
the density of electrons well we can

179
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,929
写出电子密度的近似表达式
write sort of an approximate expression
for the density of electrons which will

180
00:17:07,929 --> 00:17:16,300
在原子αZ子alpha Z上写一些总和，这里是原子数
write as some sum over atoms alpha Z sub
alpha Z here being the atomic number

181
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:23,230
原子的原子序数alpha原子序数是其中的电子数
atomic number of atom alpha atomic
number being the number of electrons in

182
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,569
原子中的质子数也乘以某些函数
the in the atom also the number of
protons in the atom times some function

183
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:35,230
我称R的G sub alpha减去R alpha，我想我们可以这样称呼
I'll call G sub alpha of R minus R alpha
which I guess we can call something like

184
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:46,570
归一化的形状函数，因此其积分为1，我们可以进行比较
a shape function which is normalized so
it's integral is 1 and we can compare

185
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,400
与我们这里所看到的相似，除了这里是一个三角洲
that to what we have over here looks
kind of similar except here it's a delta

186
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,720
函数，这里不是增量函数，所以区别是
function and here it's not a delta
function so the the difference being

187
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,710
当您是中子时，您只会从核中飞散
that when you if you're a neutron you
you scatter off of only the nucleus

188
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,450
而如果您是X射线，则您会散射整个原子，因此您可以
whereas if you're an x-ray you scatter
off of the whole atom so you can kind of

189
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,980
认为这个G是一个非常非常胖的Delta函数，它散布开来
think of this G as being a very very fat
Delta function it's spread out spreading

190
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:12,429
将Delta函数转换为某些函数，您知道它只需要
out the Delta function into some
function there's you know it just takes

191
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,480
考虑到原子中所有电子的整体大小，因此将其视为
into account the entire size of all the
electrons in the atom so think of it as

192
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:23,860
一种原子，所以现在我应该说，这种形式
a sort of atom so now I should say
however that this this form where we're

193
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,600
总结所有这些不同原子的形状乘以
summing up over the shapes of all these
different atoms times the number of

194
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,170
每个原子中的电子有点近似，原因是
electrons in each atom is a little bit
approximate and the reason it's a little

195
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,550
有点近似是因为这里有一个隐含的假设
bit approximate is because there's an
assumption the hidden assumption here

196
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,210
如果原子的形状独立于其环境
that the shape of the atom is
independent of its environment if an

197
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,050
原子碰巧与一种特定类型的原子结合，实际上
atom happens to be bonded to an one
particular type of atom it will actually

198
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,790
稍微扭曲原子的电子云，因此形状将改变
distort the electron cloud of the atom a
little bit so the shape will change a

199
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:51,850
一点，我们已经忽略了它，如果它键合到另一种原子上
little bit and we've ignored that and if
it's bonded to a different type of atom

200
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:55,240
它的形状会在另一个方向上发生一些变化
its shape will will change a little bit
in maybe another direction it will

201
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,730
取决于粘合方向，依此类推，依此类推
depend on which direction it's bonded
and so forth and so on

202
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:01,700
但是-这是一个非常好的第一近似
but
- a very good first approximation this

203
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:07,430
是描述任何电子密度的形状的一种很好的方法
is a fairly good way to describe the the
shape of the density of electrons in any

204
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:10,730
水晶，只要您知道自己具有特定类型的原子的形状， 
crystal just you know you have a shape
of for a particular type of atom and you

205
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:14,210
将其加到所有原子上，而忽略相邻原子将
add it up over all atoms and you ignore
the fact that neighboring atoms will

206
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:22,280
扭曲形状好吧好吧，所以我们可以采用这种形式的
distort the shape okay good all right
so we can take this form of the of the

207
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,150
电子密度并再次构造G的结构因子s 
density of electrons and again construct
the structure factor s of G which is now

208
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:37,010
所有原子的总和D 3的alpha积分与我们所做的非常相似
sum over all atoms atoms alpha integral
of D 3 are very similar to what we did

209
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:44,930
就在单位晶格上方，然后我们有e到IJ点R，有z 
just over here over the unit cell then
we have e to the I J dot R we have z

210
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:54,080
 sub-alpha，如果我们为您进行转换，我们有R-R alpha的G sub alpha 
sub-alpha and we have G sub alpha of R -
R alpha if we do that for you transform

211
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,480
我们得到的东西与我们在这里得到的东西非常相似
what we get is extremely similar to what
we get over here very similar to this

212
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,240
在这里，我们得到的方程式是亚当斯α和
equation here what we get is of the
following form sum over adams alpha and

213
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:16,010
 e到IG点RF子alpha的e单位单元格，请使用其他字母作为
unit cell of e to the I G dot R F sub
alpha you use different letter as a

214
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:24,740
 G的函数这称为原子形状因数
function of G this is known as the
atomic form factor form factor it

215
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,310
取决于我们正在谈论的原子类型以及您是否想知道
depends on the type of atom we're
talking about and if you want to know

216
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,210
原子形状因数实际上是什么，所以实际上可以将其与
what the atomic form factor actually is
so actually maybe just compare it to

217
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,830
在这里，原子形状因子代替了核散射
over here the atomic form factor takes
the place of the nuclear scattering

218
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:41,090
此处的长度代替了B alpha，但整体结构
length over here of this takes the place
of the B alpha but the overall structure

219
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:45,740
这个方程的结构因子的
of that of the of the structure factor
here of this equation stays pretty much

220
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:50,000
相同的唯一区别是原子形状因子也是
the same the only difference is the
atomic form factor is also a function of

221
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,530
阶梯的倒数晶格矢量G，而在这里不是
the of the ladder the reciprocal lattice
vector G whereas over here it's not and

222
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,410
之所以不在这里是因为我们有一个很好的简单Delta函数
the reason it's not over here is because
we have a nice simple Delta function

223
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:02,720
在这里进行互动，如果您在这里进行更复杂的互动
interaction over here and we have a more
complicated interaction over here if you

224
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,340
想知道G的f的实际形式，实际上是整数d3r 
want to know the actual form of f of G
it's actually an integral d3r it's just

225
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,400
我想也许萨瓦尔（Salal）提出了傅立叶变换gr t sub-alpha 
the Fourier transform
gr t sub-alpha I guess maybe Saval put

226
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
首先是z子alpha，然后是我们的G子alpha，所以它只是傅立叶
the z sub-alpha first then G sub alpha
of our so it's just the Fourier

227
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,410
形状函数G的变换也许是这个积分是
transform of the shape function G the
surprise maybe is this integral is

228
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:33,230
实际上不仅在晶胞上，而且在整个空间上，我都不会
actually over all space not just over
the unit cell and that I'm not going to

229
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,860
经过整个推导，我认为有一个修订作业
go through the whole derivation I think
there's a revision homework assignment

230
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:41,330
要求您尝试解决它，也许是去年，也许是
that asks you to try to work through it
maybe or there was last year maybe it's

231
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:44,510
今年不存在，但是值得尝试，因为它在书中
not there this year but it's worth
trying to do it's it's it's in the book

232
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,070
但是请尝试说服您积分应该是整体空间，然后让
but the to try to convince you that the
integral should be overall space and let

233
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:54,740
我提出以下论点，所以这些形状函数G的尾巴很长
me make the following argument so these
these shape functions G have long tails

234
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,620
我的意思是，这些尾巴很小，但它们却很长，如果您只是
I mean this tails are small but they but
they go out a long way if you're only

235
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,780
加总晶胞内的原子，您将永远不会感觉到
adding up over atoms within the unit
cell you would never feel the tail of

236
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,500
这些形状函数之一，因为您只累加了
one of those those shape functions
because you're only adding up over

237
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,820
晶胞内的Alpha，但是您应该包括所有的尾巴
alphas within the unit cell what but you
should be including the tails of all

238
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,040
你的邻居，所以那里有亚当斯的出路，其他
your neighbors
so there's Adams way out there and other

239
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,580
单位细胞，那么您应该感觉到那些形状的尾巴
unit cells then you should be feeling
the tails of those of those shape

240
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,100
功能，所以您要整合所有空间的事实是
functions and so the the fact that
you're integrating all over all space is

241
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,810
跟踪G的短距离部分和G的尾部
keeping track of both the short-range
part of G and the tails of the of the

242
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,980
 G来自更远的其他原子，所以它们全都吸引了我一些
G's from other atoms farther away so
they all sort of get me some and come

243
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:38,330
到这里的形状因素中，所以我将不做推导
into the the form factor here okay so
I'm not going to do the derivation it's

244
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:43,550
可能不值得做，但无论如何可能都是在做些有趣的事
probably not worth doing but
might be where it's doing for fun anyway

245
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,820
该形状因数的形式或多或少看起来像这样，所以我们将绘制F 
the the form of this form factor more or
less looks like this so we'll draw F

246
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:59,720
 alpha在这里，对于G等于零，对于G等于零，我们将在此处绘制G 
alpha here we'll draw G over here for G
equal to zero for G equals zero equals

247
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,060
零个F sub alpha只是Z sub alpha它基本上只是在计算你可以
zero F sub alpha is just Z sub alpha
it's just basically counting you can

248
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:10,790
有点看是否在空间G上的那个整数中插入零
kind of see if you insert zero into that
integral over space G is a normalized

249
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:18,140
形状函数，这样您就可以使Z返回，因此，如果G为零，则可以得到Z sub 
shape function so you just get Z back
out so so if G is zero you get Z sub

250
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:23,630
 Alpha在这里，但随后会逐渐衰减到更小
alpha up here but then it sort of decays
slowly down to something much smaller

251
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:30,740
并且衰变长度在的原子半径范围内或多或少为1 
and the decay length is more or less 1
over the radius of the atom radius of

252
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:37,430
原子经常被人们认为α的F是一个近似值
atom very frequently people just make
the approximation that F of alpha is a

253
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,600
常数，常数就是电子数，因为你知道
constant and the constant is just the
number of electrons because you know if

254
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,380
你有更多的电子，你从原子上散射的更多，所以让我们
you have more electrons you scatter more
off of it off of the atom so just let's

255
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,070
假设形状因子与G无关，并且基本上
assume that the form factor is
independent of G and it's basically just

256
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:53,150
与G中的电子数成正比，这并不可怕
proportional to the number number of
electrons in G it's not a horrible

257
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:57,830
近似值并不完全正确，但还算不错，让您的生活更美好
approximation it isn't completely right
but it's not too bad and makes your life

258
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,350
简单得多，它使X射线问题看起来更像
a lot simpler it makes the the x-ray
problem look a lot more like the the

259
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:07,340
这些B的形状因子不依赖于G的中子问题
neutron problem where these this form
factor this B doesn't depend on G

260
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,980
不再依赖于互易的晶格因子，而是严格地
anymore it doesn't depend on the
reciprocal lattice factor but strictly

261
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,760
讲F应该衰减也是G的函数，所以通常在
speaking F should decay as a function of
G as well so generally where they were

262
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,030
谈论X射线，或者我们谈论中子，总是会有G 
talking about x-rays or we're talking
about neutrons will always have s of G

263
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:31,550
单元格e中的adams alpha adams alpha上以下形式的总和
of the following form sum over adams
alpha adams alpha in unit cell e to the

264
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:41,060
 IG点R alpha，然后我将其写为G的f但或或alpha的野兽
I G dot R alpha and then well I'll write
it as f of G but or or beasts of alpha

265
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,649
如果我们在谈论中子，那么经常重写是很方便的
if we're talking about neutrons
it's convenient frequently to rewrite

266
00:24:46,649 --> 00:24:52,710
就米勒指数而言，因此，如果我们根据
this in terms of Miller indices so if we
rewrite these statements in terms of

267
00:24:52,710 --> 00:25:01,919
米勒指数，我们将在晶胞e中获得超过2 alpha H倍的alpha值
Miller indices we would have some over
alpha in unit cell e to the 2 pi H times

268
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:11,309
 u alpha加K乘以V alpha加L乘以W F为F sub alpha HKL，所以
u alpha plus K times V alpha plus L
times W alpha of F sub alpha H K L so

269
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:26,820
这里H KL h KL是GG向量和u alpha的Miller指数
here H KL h KL is the Miller indices
Miller indices of G G vector and u alpha

270
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:43,009
 v alpha W alpha等于原子alpha alpha在晶胞中的位置
v alpha W alpha equals position position
of atom alpha alpha in unit cell okay

271
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:49,500
到目前为止，让人们开心的事让我们实际做一个例子
that make people happy good so far all
right let's actually do an example to

272
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:56,960
使其中的一些内容更加清晰，因此我们之前讨论过的示例材料
make make some of this more clear so
example material we talked about before

273
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:05,159
氯化铯，所以您还记得氯化铯是简单立方的
cesium chloride so you remember cesium
chloride is simple cubic with basis with

274
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:20,330
基，并且基的铯为0 0 0 0 0 0 0，氯为1/2 1/2 1/2 
basis and the basis has a cesium at 0 0
0 0 0 0 and a chlorine at 1/2 1/2 1/2

275
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:24,450
实际上我想我可能对此有一张照片，我希望这看起来
and actually I think I may have a
picture of that yeah I hope this looks

276
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,330
熟悉的我们花了一些时间讨论它
familiar we spent some time discussing
it

277
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,899
因此，使用该表达式作为结构因子，我们可以编写s 
so using that expression for the
structure factor we can we can write s

278
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:41,490
在香港，l等于好，所以它将是单元中两个原子的总和
at HK l equals okay so it's going to be
a sum over the two atoms in the unit

279
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,730
单元格，因此第一个原子位于0 0 0，因此e 
cell
so the first atom is at 0 0 0 so e to

280
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:49,139
 2 pi然后我们在楼上有一堆零，所以第一个项将是
the 2 pi then we have a bunch of zeros
upstairs so the first term will just be

281
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:56,420
 F铯，因为e到2 pi 0只会给你一个好处，这
F cesium because e to the 2 pi 0 is just
going to give you one good and this

282
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:06,290
我们将F氯乘以e到2 pi，然后将h乘以1/2加K 
we'll be F chlorine times e to the 2 pi
and then we have h times 1/2 plus K

283
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:14,650
乘以1/2加L乘以1/2可以堵住氯气的位置
times 1/2 plus L times 1/2
ok plugging in the position of chlorine

284
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:21,980
 UV和W均为氯的1/2现在我可以将其重写为FC并严格
UV and W both being 1/2 for chlorine now
I can rewrite that as FC and strictly

285
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:27,980
严格来说，我应该给铯中的F和HKL中的F氯
speaking strictly speaking I should have
given F at cesium and F chlorine HKL

286
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,610
我刚在那边大声疾呼的依赖，所以他们严格来说
dependencies as I just ranted about up
there so they're strictly speaking there

287
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:40,370
也是h KL的功能h KL的弱功能也取决于
are also functions of h KL weak
functions of h KL as well they depend

288
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:45,860
关于G的大小，但我通常不会写那个
slightly on on the magnitude of G but I
typically won't write that write that

289
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,370
依赖性，但您必须记住它确实存在，因此我们可以重写
dependence but you have to remember that
it's actually there so we can rewrite

290
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:53,810
作为这里的铯，为了方便起见，我将不再依赖HK L 
that as f cesium in here I'm gonna drop
the dependence on HK L for convenience

291
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:59,690
乘以F clora加上F氯，然后将此e乘以2 pi H乘以1/2加上
times F clora plus F chlorine and this
factor of e to the 2 pi H times 1/2 plus

292
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,620
想要拥有的K倍1/2加L倍实际上是h减去1/2加k加L 
K times 1/2 plus L times want to have is
actually minus 1/2 the h plus k plus L

293
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,880
很好，所以这是结构因素，您把这个东西平方即可得到
good so this is the structure factor and
you square this thing this will give you

294
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,430
 20的平方，它将使您的散射幅度为2o，K为负
the 20 squared it will give you the
amplitude of scattering 2o with K minus

295
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:22,630
米勒指数给出的K素数HK L好吧，让我们再举一个例子
K prime given by Miller indices HK L
okay all right let's do another example

296
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:30,370
举例来说，纯铯旁边的两个是铯，现在您还记得那是BCC 
example two next to pure cesium here are
cesium now you remember that that's BCC

297
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:38,930
但BCC可以被认为是简单的三次方，其基础是
but BCC can be thought of as simple
cubic with a basis with basis where the

298
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:50,690
铯是0 0 0，铯是1/2 1/2 1/2，换句话说，我们只是
basis is cesium at 0 0 0 and cesium at
1/2 1/2 1/2 so in other words we're just

299
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:58,790
我们之前已经讨论过用另一种铯代替氯，所以有
replacing the chlorine by another cesium
we discussed this before and so there's

300
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,540
它的图片，所以您只需用铯代替氯即可， 
a picture of it so you just replace the
chlorine with a cesium so we get exactly

301
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,370
相同的结果，但现在是f氯，这是来自中心的氯
the same result except now f chlorine
and this is the chlorine from the center

302
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,930
的单位电池与f铯相同，所以现在我们将
of the unit cell it's
to be the same as f cesium so now we'll

303
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:24,260
得到s HK l等于f铯+ f铯x-1直至h加k加L，我们
get s HK l equals f cesium + f cesium x
- 1 up to the h plus k plus L and we

304
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:29,750
想要我们可以分解出铯，并将铯乘以1加负1 
want to we can factor out the F cesium
and write f cesium times 1 plus minus 1

305
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:37,250
 h加k加L现在，您会注意到它消失了，除非写下
the h plus k plus L now you'll notice
that this vanishes unless write this

306
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:50,270
下降消失，更少的h加k加L等于H加k加L等于
down vanishes and less h plus k plus L
is even H plus k plus L is even this is

307
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,830
所谓的选择规则或系统性缺席，也许我会写
what's known as a selection rule or a
systematic absence maybe I'll write

308
00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:07,990
那些选择不足的人将统治或系统性缺席系统性缺席
those down selection will rule or
systematic absence systematic absence

309
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:17,600
缺席感系系统性缺席
absence absence sense systematic absence
um the idea being that you will get no

310
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,470
除非h加k加L都是偶数，否则所有具有h的米勒指数
scattering unless h plus k plus L is
even so all of the Miller indices with h

311
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:27,350
加k加al为奇数根本没有散射
plus k plus al being odd have no
scattering at all they are

312
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:31,400
有序地从散射或其他方式来
systematically absent from this from the
scattering or another way words in order

313
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,040
为了得到散射，您必须满足此选择规则，这通常是
to get scattering you must satisfy this
selection rule and this is generally

314
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,440
对于BCC晶格为true对于BCC晶格对于BCC晶格，这些是选择
true for BCC lattices for BCC lattices
for BCC lattices these are the selection

315
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:52,340
现在就规则了，所以每当您进行分散实验时，如果发现
rules now so whenever you do a
scattering experiment if you discover

316
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,420
这些米向量的所有米勒指数都由H加k加
that all the Miller indices scattering
by these wave vectors with H plus k plus

317
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,070
如果发现h加k加L的奇数没有
L not any time if you discover that h
plus k plus L odd that there's no

318
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,420
在那些米勒指数处将其散射，但您确实发现了h的散射
scattering it there at those Miller
indices but you do find scattering for h

319
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:10,630
加k加L甚至很好地打赌您拥有的是BCC晶格
plus k plus L even it's a very very good
bet that what you have is a BCC lattice

320
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:15,980
但是你会被愚弄你怎么会被愚弄你会被愚弄
however you can be fooled how can you be
fooled you can be fooled

321
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,600
例如，让我们考虑一下氯化铯的情况
for example let's consider the case of
cesium chloride suppose just

322
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,340
巧合的是铯和氟氯在某种程度上彼此相等
coincidentally F cesium and F chlorine
we're equal to each other by some

323
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:29,330
巧合的是，在这种情况下，您将在这里消失得一样
coincidence in which case you'd get the
same vanishing over here you'd have the

324
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:34,159
相同的选择角色，但是如果它们不同，则可能
same selection role but if they're
different maybe by a little bit then the

325
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,239
选择规则几乎可以满足，这意味着您必须看起来很真实
selection rule is almost satisfied
meaning that you'd have to look really

326
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,600
真的很认真地看到有一些振幅，因为这些会
really carefully to see that there was
some amplitude because these would

327
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,799
几乎完全取消，所以抓住氯化物不具有此特性F 
almost exactly cancel so seizing
chloride does not have this property F

328
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:49,309
铯和F氯不是很相似，但是有非常相似的
cesium and F chlorine are not very
similar but there's a very very similar

329
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:53,600
这两个材料非常接近的材料，您可能会
material for which these two are
extremely close and you might be

330
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,070
如果您查看数据，可能会误会，并且可能会出错，除非
mistaken you might if you looked at the
data you might make a mistake and unless

331
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,289
你仔细地看了一下，就会以为
you looked at it really carefully you
would think that you would have the same

332
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:07,340
任何人都想猜出该物质是什么氯化钾的选择规则
selection rule anyone want to guess what
that material is what potassium chloride

333
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,729
你以为你是谁说过的话我还是会给你的
who do you think you said that way up
there I'll give this to you anyway but

334
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:14,090
这不是正确的答案氯化钾是一个很好的猜测
it's not the right answer
potassium chloride is a very good guess

335
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,129
而之所以认为和氯化物是一个很好的猜测是因为
and the reason the reason for that and
chloride is a good guess is because

336
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:25,759
请记住，这些F这些形状因子基本上与原子成正比
remember that these F these form factors
are basically proportional to the atomic

337
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,590
铯和氯的原子数和原子数有很大不同
number and the atomic number of cesium
and chlorine are extremely different

338
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:35,840
氯是什么氯氯是17号而铯是55号
chlorine is what is chlorine chlorine is
number 17 and cesium is number number 55

339
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,529
因此这两个数字将有很大的不同，但是如果您替换了
so these two numbers will be extremely
different but if you replaced the

340
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:43,700
氯铯与钾钾在上方
chlorine the cesium with potassium
potassium is right above it on the

341
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,009
周期表在化学上非常相似，然后看到钾具有原子
periodic table it's chemically very
similar then see potassium has atomic

342
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:53,929
 19号和氯原子序号为17，所以这些原子数是多余的， 
number 19 and chlorine has the atomic
number 17 so these would be extra and

343
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:58,099
您几乎要取消氯化钾是不正确的答案，因为
you'd have a near cancellation potassium
chloride is not the right answer because

344
00:32:58,099 --> 00:33:01,429
实际上，氯化钾并不具有这种晶体结构，它需要
in fact potassium chloride does not take
this crystal structure and it takes a

345
00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:05,119
不同的晶体结构是FCC，就像是氯化钠，是FCC 
different crystal structure is FCC it's
like it's like sodium chloride it's FCC

346
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,899
在此基础上还有另一种材料，但这暗示着其他
with the basis there's another material
but that's a hint what's the other

347
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,340
更像氯化铯的物质
material that would be more like cesium
chloride

348
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:19,220
不，不，镁，不，不，我要自己保留这个，这是一些
no not magnesium no no all right I'm
gonna keep this one myself it's some

349
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:25,909
碘化铯，如果用2 2个空格的碘代替氯
caesium iodide if you replace chlorine
with iodine which is which is 2 2 spaces

350
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:31,909
在它的周期表下，碘的原子序数为53和铯
under it on the periodic table the
iodine has atomic number 53 and caesium

351
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:37,100
原子序数为55，因此这两者之间的取消为
has atomic number 55 so the cancellation
between these two would be

352
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,299
几乎完全正确，我的意思是您只需要几个百分点
almost exact I mean only within a few
percent you would you would have a

353
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:45,530
轻微的非取消，因此您很容易犯错误并查看
slight non cancellation so you it's very
easy to make the mistake and look at the

354
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,650
数据，并认为您拥有密件抄送格，因为您认为
data and think that you have a BCC
lattice because you think there's a

355
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:52,070
全身性的缺失，但是如果仔细观察，就会发现
systemic absence but if you look at it
much much more closely you discover that

356
00:33:52,070 --> 00:34:00,940
事实上，这并不能完美消除所有人的快乐，好吧，好吧
in fact it's not perfectly canceling
okay everyone happy all right so right

357
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:08,449
考虑到FCC FCC的情况，我们可以对FCC格做同样的事情
we can do the same thing with with FCC
lattices considering a case of FCC FCC

358
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:18,499
晶格，所以对于FCC，我们可以认为FCC等于基本简单立方时间

359
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:27,260
简单的三次方，偶然的基础，我应该有
basis simple cubic times the basis
incidentally um I should I should have

360
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,710
提到这一点，如果我们正在研究核散射长度，那么有
mentioned this if we were looking at
nuclear scattering lengths then there's

361
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:33,949
绝对没有理由您应该期望任何两个都一样
absolutely no reason you should ever
expect any two would be the same

362
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:36,799
与他们的原子序数无关，因为我的意思是你可以拥有一个

363
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,030
氢的散射长度恰好发生在一个奇怪的巧合
strange coincidence that the scattering
lengths of hydrogen happens to happen to

364
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:44,570
匹配铁的散射长度或类似的疯狂东西，但
match the scattering length of iron or
something crazy like that but just

365
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:47,600
因为它们在元素周期表中彼此靠近并不意味着
because they're close to each other in
the periodic table doesn't mean that

366
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,500
他们有紧密的核散射长度，完全不相关，所以
they have close nuclear scattering
lengths completely unrelated so it's

367
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,070
如果您认为几乎可以取消使用X射线，那有时会很好
sometimes good if you think there's a
near cancellation to switch from x-rays

368
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,400
到中子，因为X射线几乎不会抵消
to neutrons because a near cancellation
with x-rays won't be in near

369
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,190
用中子消除通常可以回到FCC FCC，我们可以认为
cancellation with neutrons generally all
right back to FCC FCC and we can think

370
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:11,540
它是简单的三次方，其底基等于底基等于0 0 0 0 
of it as simple cubic with a basis where
the basis equals basis equals 0 0 0 0

371
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:26,000
和1/2 1/2 0 1/2 0 1/2和0 1/2 1/2实际上我想我有一张
and 1/2 1/2 0 1/2 0 1/2 and 0 1/2 1/2
actually I think I have a picture of

372
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,790
还要记住，从FCC的一些演讲之前，这是
that as well remember this from from a
couple lectures ago the FCC lattice is

373
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:39,230
可以穿透简单的三次方，所以我们可以写出结构因子
for interpenetrating simple cubics okay
so we can write the structure factor the

374
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:45,950
结构因子将是这四个四个晶格点的总和
structure factor is going to be the sum
over all these four four lattice points

375
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,960
在e到2 pi和i'的常规单位格内
within the conventional unit cell of e
to the 2 pi and i'll

376
00:35:49,960 --> 00:36:01,990
这个HKL点到UV W点alpha中，我们可以写成1加e到
this HKL dotted into UV W point alpha
which we can then write as 1 plus e to

377
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:11,589
 I pi h加，所以一个是从0 0 0，那么我将得到h加k加e 
the I pi h plus so one is from 0 0 0
then we'll have h plus k plus e to the I

378
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:23,740
 pi H加L加e至I pi k加L，然后等于1加-1至
pi H plus L plus e to the I pi k plus L
which is then equal to 1 plus -1 to the

379
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:32,800
 h加k加-1到h加L加1减去k加L然后我声称
h plus k plus -1 to the h plus L plus
minus 1 the k plus L then I claim that

380
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:51,490
除非HK l HK L全部为偶数或全部为奇数，并且使您信服， 
this vanishes unless HK l HK L all even
or all odd and to convince you of that

381
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:56,050
如果HK和L都是偶数，那么所有这些指数集都是偶数，所以它是1 
if HK and L are all even then all those
sets of exponents are even so it's 1

382
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,510
加1加1加1，如果HK和L均为奇数，则再加到加在一起的几率
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 if HK and L are all
odd then again to odds added together

383
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:05,890
总是给你一个偶数，所以它又是1加1加1加1但如果你有
always give you an even so it's again 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 but if you have for

384
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:10,450
例如，一个奇数和两个偶数让我们考虑一下这种情况，假设H为
example one odd and two evens let's
think about that case let's suppose H is

385
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:16,240
奇数，并且K和L或什至然后H加K为奇数h加上L为奇数，但k加L为偶数
odd and K and L or even then H plus K is
odd h plus L is odd but k plus L is even

386
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,500
所以我们将有1减1减1加1并消失，您可以说服
so we'll have 1 minus 1 minus 1 plus 1
and vanishes and you can convince

387
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:24,820
你自己，除非HK和L全都是奇数
yourself that unless HK and L are either
all even are all odd

388
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:37,839
您会消失的，所以这是FCC的选择规则，所以在哪里
you'll get your vanish so this is a
selection rule rule for for FCC so where

389
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,339
如果您还记得的话，请执行这些选择规则实际来自的地方
do these where these selection rules
actually come from if you remember back

390
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:45,910
到上一讲或我们讨论晶格族之前的讲课
to the last lecture or the lecture
before we discussed families of lattice

391
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,070
平面以及米勒指数的某些集合与
planes and how it is that certain sets
of Miller indices do not correspond to

392
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,970
 BCC和FCC晶格的晶格平面族，因此请记住例如
families of lattice planes for BCC and
FCC lattices so remember for example

393
00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:00,730
 1 0 0晶格平面族或倒数晶格向量对应于
with 1 0 0 family of lattice planes or
reciprocal lattice vector corresponds to

394
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,640
这些这些平面的简单立方
this these sets of planes for simple
cubic

395
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,900
如果我尝试将一个零零用于BCC，那将不是最后一个家庭
if I tried to use that one zero zero for
BCC it would not be a family of last

396
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,520
飞机，因为您会想念常规中心的家伙
planes because you would miss the the
guy in the center of the conventional

397
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:17,290
晶胞必须上升到两个零零才能获得第二好的
unit cell you have to go up to two zero
zero in order to get that second best

398
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:22,030
中间的额外平面的平面间距较小，以便抓住
the extra plane in the middle a smaller
plane spacing in order to catch that

399
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:26,040
常规晶胞中间的附加晶格点
additional additional lattice point in
the middle of the conventional unit cell

400
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,160
好吧伙计，这听起来很熟悉吗，我希望如此
okay dude is this sound familiar vaguely
familiar I hope so

401
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:40,450
现在这就是为什么2 0 0满足BCC选择规则，而1 0 0一打
now this is why 2 0 0 satisfies the BCC
selection rule whereas 1 0 0 a dozen for

402
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:45,670
密件抄送的选择规则是h加k加L应为2 
BCC the selection rule is that h plus k
plus L should be even that is true for 2

403
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,690
 0 0这不是选择规则的起源1 0 0 
0 0 it is not true for 1 0 0 that's the
origin of the selection rule the

404
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,100
选择规则询问这组已知索引实际上何时
selection rule is asking when is this
set of known indices actually a

405
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,190
此特定晶格的倒数晶格矢量
reciprocal lattice vector for this
particular lattice that's where it's

406
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,500
来自您可以看到另一种情况1 1 1 1 1 1使这些对角线
coming from you can see another case
with 1 1 1 1 1 1 makes these diagonal

407
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:08,800
飞机在这里横穿单位晶胞，但如果
planes here cutting across the unit cell
here but it would miss the BCC point if

408
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,890
我们在考虑BCC时，我们会错过
we was thinking about BCC we'd be
missing the point in the center of the

409
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:17,200
单位晶格，如果去2 2 2则具有两倍于
unit cell if you went to 2 2 2 you have
twice the density of lattice plane of

410
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,730
飞机在这里，您将捕捉到单元中心的晶格点
planes here and you would catch the
lattice point in the center of the unit

411
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:26,200
单元1 1 1不满足B加选择规则，即h加k加L 
cell 1 1 1 does not satisfy the BCC
selection rule that h plus k plus L

412
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,060
应该是偶数，而2 2 2可以，所以这就是当你有一个
should be even whereas 2 2 2 does okay
so that's how you tell when you have a

413
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,500
真正的接收者温迪·米勒（Wendy Miller）指数实际上代表一个倒数晶格
real recipient Wendy Miller indices
actually represent a reciprocal lattice

414
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,100
向量，当它们满足
vector they represent a reciprocal
lattice vector when they satisfy the

415
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:42,460
选择角色，当它们出现时，它们不代表倒易的晶格向量
selection role and they do not represent
a reciprocal lattice vector when they do

416
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:48,870
不能代表它满足选择角色，好吧，是的，很好
not represent it satisfy the selection
role okay make sense yeah good all right

417
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:55,180
关于这些选择规则，这些方面真的很酷的一件事是
one thing that's really cool about these
about these selection rules is that in

418
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,890
事实上，当您可以描述任何晶体时，我们可以将晶体描述为晶格
fact when you can describe any crystal
we can describe a crystal as a lattice

419
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:03,700
这十四种晶格类型中的任何一种乘以基数，这是其中之一
any one of these fourteen lattice types
times a basis this is one of the things

420
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,370
我们检查了晶体结构，例如氯化钠
we went over we did crystal structure
for example sodium chloride

421
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,880
这是FCC晶格，然后乘以一个基础，告诉您有钠
it's an FCC lattice but then times a
basis which tells you there's a sodium

422
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,310
为零零零，氯为1/2 1 1/2 1/2时，选择规则仍为
is zero zero zero and a chlorine at 1/2
1 1/2 1/2 the selection rules remain the

423
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:20,790
相同于倾向于选择规则的规则
same in
tend to the basis selection rules rules

424
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:31,110
在基础上是独立的，因此有助记符
are independent independent in depth of
basis so there's a mnemonic for how it

425
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:35,400
是人们记得这一点吗？经常说s是s 
is that people remember this it's
frequently said that s is s for the

426
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:42,840
晶格乘以s为基础，因此如果s的晶格消失，则整个
lattice times s for the basis so if s
for the lattice vanishes then the whole

427
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:49,800
事情消失了，所以让我们看看是否可以放一些您知道的方程式
thing vanishes ok so let's see if we can
put some you know some equations behind

428
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,640
我的意思是s为晶格乘以s为基础，所以让我们
this what I mean by s for the lattice
times s for the basis all right so let's

429
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:03,630
回想一下，s将是亚当斯alpha和f sub alpha的晶胞的总和
recall that s is going to be a sum over
adams alpha and unit cell of f sub alpha

430
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:12,750
 e到i g-- r alpha然后我们可以用a来写任何原子alpha 
e to the i g-- r alpha and then we can
write any atom alpha in terms of a

431
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:18,930
晶格点和基向量x，所以这是晶格点大R 
lattice point and a basis vector x so
this is lattice point big R that point

432
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:26,460
 X是基向量基，因此它的位置R alpha是
and X is the basis vector basis so that
its position R alpha is the position of

433
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:32,070
该原子的晶格矢量R和该原子的基矢量X 
the lattice vector R for that atom and
the basis vector X for that atom so for

434
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:37,830
例如，钠的X为0，它正好位于晶格上
example X for sodium here is 0 it's
sitting right on the lattice where X for

435
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:42,660
氯是1/2 1/2 1/2这告诉你要找出一个氯的位置
chlorine is 1/2 1/2 1/2 which tells you
that you take to find the position of a

436
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:46,770
氯到达晶格点，然后将其放在向量X处
chlorine you go to a lattice point and
then you just place it by a vector X for

437
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:50,460
氯是1/2 1/2 1/2所以我只是写原子的坐标
chlorine which is 1/2 1/2 1/2 so I'm
just writing the coordinates of the atom

438
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,250
就其晶格坐标和基础位移而言，可以
in terms of its lattice coordinate and
the basis displacement okay all right so

439
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:05,430
那么我们就可以这样写s为R上的和X上的和
then we can write s in terms of this as
sum over R in lattice sum over X in

440
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:13,770
基于F的形式因数仅取决于X，因此它仅取决于X 
basis of F the form factor is only going
to depend on X because it only cares

441
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,250
您正在谈论的原子类型是钠还是氯，所以
what type of atom you're talking about
whether it's a sodium or a chlorine so f

442
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:23,700
这里只取决于X乘以e到I G，然后位置R小R大
only depends on X here times e to the I
G and then the position R small R is big

443
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:32,730
 R加上大R加上大X好的，那么我们可以将其写为
R plus big R plus big X
okay then we can factor this write it as

444
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:46,200
等于R在晶格时间e中的和与I GE R在X和基数上的和
equal to sum over R in lattice times e
to the I GE R times sum over X and basis

445
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:58,289
在F sub X e到IG点X的基础上，所以这就是我们上面计算的
in basis F sub X e to the I G dot X okay
so this is what we just calculated above

446
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:07,809
这是s的格子，这是s的基础，所以真的很漂亮
this is s for the lattice and this here
is s for the basis so it's really pretty

447
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:12,339
严格说来，任何晶体的结构因素就是结构
much strictly true that the structure
factor for any crystal is the structure

448
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:16,720
晶格系数乘以结构系数
factor for the lattice alone times the
structure factor this factor here for

449
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,799
基础，因此如果晶格的结构因子消失，换句话说，如果
the basis so if the structure factor for
the lattice vanishes in other words if

450
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:24,819
您不满足晶格类型的选择规则，则
you're not satisfying the selection rule
for the for the lattice type then the

451
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:27,819
整个事情都会消失，所以无论您的复杂程度如何
whole thing is going to vanish so it
doesn't matter how complicated your

452
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:32,410
基础是如果是FCC为了获得散射，您必须满足FCC 
basis is if it's FCC in order to get
scattering you have to satisfy the FCC

453
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,880
 HK和L的散布规则必须全部为偶数或全部为奇数行，现在有一个
scattering rules in H K and L have to be
all even or all odd okay now there's a

454
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,190
解释您必须满足选择的陈述的方式
way to interpret this statement that
that you have to satisfy the selection

455
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:47,260
规则仅用于晶格，以便从复杂的物体中散射
rule for the lattice alone in order to
get scattering from a complicated

456
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,849
晶体，所以让我们考虑一下这张图片，用氯化钠
crystal so let's think about this
picture here with sodium chloride for a

457
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:56,349
再想一秒钟，我们忽略了氯，只是摆脱了
second imagine for a second that we
ignore the chlorines just get rid of the

458
00:43:56,349 --> 00:44:00,970
氯，然后剩下的就是FCC晶格上的钠，以便
chlorines and then what we have left is
sodium's on an FCC lattice in order to

459
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,599
从那些钠中得到X射线散射或中子散射
get x-ray scattering or neutron
scattering from those sodium's you have

460
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:08,950
满足选择规则，否则您将不会从中分散
to satisfy the selection rule otherwise
you get no scattering from it now let's

461
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,099
摆脱钠是，并把氯中的氯也
get rid of the sodium is and put the
chlorines in the chlorines are also

462
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:15,880
形成一个完整的FCC晶格，以便从
forming a complete FCC lattice and in
order to get scattering from the

463
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,059
如果您放回氯气，现在必须满足选择规则
chlorines you have to satisfy the
selection rule now if you put them back

464
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:23,260
都通过叠加返回，这将是两者的总和
both back in by superposition in order
it's just going to be the sum of the two

465
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,690
从钠和苏纳特和
scatterings the scatterings from the
sodium's and the sunnat' and the

466
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:28,660
从氯中飞散出来，所以如果您不满足选择规则
scattering from the chlorines so if
you're not satisfying the selection rule

467
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,440
对于其中之一，您不是，所以您根本不会得到任何散射，所以
for one of them you're not so you're not
gonna get any scattering at all so it's

468
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,809
基本上只是说您将各个部分的散射加起来
basically just saying that you add up
the scattering from each of the pieces

469
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:41,350
分别好吧，好了，所以在下一个讲座中我们要去
separately okay all right
so in the next lecture what we're going

470
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:47,230
我们要做的是，我们将实际查看一些真实的X射线数据
to do is we're going to yeah we're going
to actually look at some real x-ray data

471
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:52,630
然后我们将分析X射线数据并推论出什么是真实的
and we're going to analyze the x-ray
data and deduce what is in some real

472
00:44:52,630 --> 00:45:00,010
材料，但其中之一应该知道
materials but one of the things that
were expected to know that sort of has

473
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,690
首先要讨论的是如何制作X射线
to be discussed is how you make x-rays
in the first place how to make make

474
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:13,300
 X射线，所以有两种制作X射线的方法，我们可能只能获得X射线
x-rays so there's two ways to make
x-rays which we may only be able to get

475
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:19,510
到今天最简单的方式，但最简单的方式又便宜又简单
to the simplest of them today but the
simple way the cheap way simple and

476
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:29,080
便宜的是使用X射线管X射线管，这是Ron Chen发现的方法
cheap is to use an x-ray tube x-ray tube
this is a method discovered by Ron Chen

477
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:37,720
追溯到1919年1900年1901年，您的想法是
way back in you know around 1919 1900
1901 the idea is you take a great big

478
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,660
此处的电压，您将其放在阴极的这一侧
voltage here and you put it across a
cathode on this side just a piece of

479
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:50,800
这边的金属和这边的大目标
metal on this side and a big target on
this side target on this side and by

480
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,940
拥有如此巨大的电压，您会将电子从阴极吐出， 
having this huge voltage
you spit electrons off the cathode and

481
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,160
电子击中目标并发出X射线，所以真正发生了什么
the electrons hit the target and off
come x-rays so what's really happening

482
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:11,400
这是电子快电子快速电子被踢出
here is that the electrons fast
electrons fast electrons kick out

483
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:19,619
来自核心轨道的电子将来自核心轨道的电子踢出
electrons from core orbitals kick out
electrons from core orbitals from core

484
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,170
而您看到的X射线主要来自其他
and the x-rays you see the x-ray lines
you actually see are mainly from other

485
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:32,490
电子从高轨道下降到核心的外观
electrons falling down from the high
orbitals down to the look to the core

486
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:37,579
轨道重新填充它们，因此请参见发射
orbitals to refill them so see emission

487
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:47,369
来自电子跃迁的跃迁，因此高电子跃迁
from transitions from electron
transitions so an electron in a high up

488
00:46:47,369 --> 00:46:52,440
轨道下降以填充核心轨道中的这些空白区域之一
orbital drops down to fill one of these
empty spaces in the in the core orbitals

489
00:46:52,440 --> 00:47:00,089
然后您会看到一条漂亮的X射线线进入了一条漂亮的X射线，现在能量
and you'll see a nice x-ray line come in
a nice x-ray coming off now the energy

490
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:06,240
过渡的时间基本上是里德伯格乘以原子
of that of that transition is basically
about the rid berg times the atomic

491
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,910
数字平方记得当你有一个氢原子的能量时
number squared remember when you have a
hydrogen atom the energy of the the

492
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:18,990
氢原子的本征态随核电荷的平方而变化，所以你知道
eigenstates of the hydrogen atom go as
the nuclear charge squared so you know

493
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,740
红鸟是13电子伏特，但如果您是
the Redbird is 13 electron volts but the
atomic number of your atom if you're

494
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,609
用铜之类的东西40之类的东西
using something like copper something
like 40 so you can have a huge huge

495
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:33,480
能量可以是几十千伏的ke v，并且将非常对应
energy this can be tens of kilovolts of
ke v and that will correspond very

496
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,770
恰好与我们想要的对应于我们想要的lambda 
nicely to what we want correspond to
what we want which is lambda

497
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:43,680
现在大约有一个埃
approximately one angstrom now there's a
couple of really nice things about this

498
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,339
这项技术真正很棒的一件事是，因为它是一种
technique one thing that's really nice
about this technique is since it's an

499
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:52,500
原子过渡，这非常非常尖锐。 
atomic transition it's very very sharp
in other words bits it's a very sharp

500
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,450
在两个不同的能级之间建立非常非常独特的过渡
line a very very distinct transition
between two distinct energy levels you

501
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:00,510
知道这里很清楚的能量水平那里很清楚的能量水平
know very clear energy level up here a
very clear energy level down there and

502
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:08,520
因此，您可以从中获得非常明确的定义明确的lambda 
so you get a very very well-defined
well-defined defined lambda out of this

503
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,109
类型的技术，这基本上就是罗恩·陈所做的
type of technique and this is basically
what what Ron Chen was doing you know

504
00:48:13,109 --> 00:48:18,780
 100 115年前的现在，在现代的现代时代，我可能有也可能没有
100 115 years ago now in modern in the
modern era I may or may not have a

505
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,690
这幅画让我看看我是否拥有它是在现代时代
picture of this let me see if I have it
yeah here in the modern era there's

506
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:31,500
另一种制作X射线的方法是一种更好的技术， 
another way to make x-rays which is sort
of favored as a better technique is only

507
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,650
这些X射线管非常便宜
these x-ray tubes they're they're
incredibly cheap

508
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,800
你能知道这是你在牙医诊所里所拥有的
you can you know this is what you have
in the doctor the dentist office when

509
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,820
口腔X射线就是其中之一，或者您知道X射线断了骨头
the x-ray your mouth is one of these
things or you know x-ray broken bones

510
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:45,180
这些就是这些东西，您可以在这座建筑物周围找到许多
it's these things and there's probably
dozen them around this building you can

511
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,510
如果愿意，可以自己建一个，但如果经常，则需要更多
build one yourself if you wanted to but
if frequently you need a much more

512
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:53,910
高科技X射线源和现代高科技X射线源被称为
high-tech x-ray source and the modern
high-tech x-ray source is known as the

513
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:59,940
同步加速器叉，在这张照片中，这是这些大建筑物之一
synchrotron prong and it's in this
picture it's one of these big buildings

514
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:05,520
这就是即将发生的事情这是钻石实验室的X射线同步加速器源
this is just down the road this is the
x-ray synchrotron source at Diamond Lab

515
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,890
就在路上，开车约十分钟，这些东西大概是十
just just up the road by about ten
minutes by car these things are about 10

516
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,960
到10倍亮10到10是10到10倍亮
to the 10th times brighter 10 to the 10
yeah 10 to the 10 times brighter more

517
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:26,430
光子，然后是X射线管，然后是X射线管，这实际上非常有用
photons then x-ray tubes then x-ray
tubes and that's actually quite useful

518
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:32,610
如果有很多现代实验来检验
to have if for a lot of modern
experiments which examine either

519
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:37,290
非常小的样本，或者您需要非常快速地收集数据，我的意思是
extremely small samples or you need to
collect data extremely quickly I mean at

520
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,200
一天结束时，您总是在计数光子
the end of the day you're always
counting photons you're sort of counting

521
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,590
如果有更多光子，则在特定方向上会散布多少光子
how many photons are scattered in
particular direction if you have more

522
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:47,280
光子特别是如果您总是会得到更好的数据
photons you always get better data if
you're if it's particularly if you're

523
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,000
看着很小的样品，很难将这些电子聚焦在
looking at a very small sample where
it's hard to focus those electrons in on

524
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,130
小样本同步加速器的总体思路是，您将这个伟大
the the small sample the general idea of
the synchrotron is you take this great

525
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,330
大环，您可以在这张照片中看到您旋转的同步加速器源
big ring which you can see in this
picture this synchrotron source you spin

526
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,230
电子围绕这个环，所以电子在这个环周围
electrons around this ring so the
electrons are going around this ring at

527
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:11,160
在GeV上非常高的速度，所以千兆电子伏特然后
very high velocities at up a GeV
so Giga electron volts and then in order

528
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,590
要从中取出X射线，您需要先带走电子，然后再将其发送通过
to get x-rays out of it you take your
electrons and then you send them through

529
00:50:16,590 --> 00:50:25,950
一堆磁铁，所以南北南北北南南这就是所谓的
a bunch of magnets so north south south
north north south this is known as an

530
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:33,750
有时是起伏器或摇摆器，其想法是电子通过
undulator or a wiggler sometimes and the
idea is that the electrons going through

531
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,990
他们正在经历非常快，而你让他们通过
this they're going through very fast and
you make them accelerate through and as

532
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:44,330
你知道加速电子会在这种情况下发出辐射
you know accelerating electrons emits
radiation in this case they will emit

533
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:48,420
定向准直的X射线辐射
directed x-ray radiation which is
extremely collimated

534
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:55,320
频率定义非常明确，如果您对某种
extremely well defined frequency and if
you're not happy with the sort of a

535
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,850
技术，这是很重要的，要知道您是否不满意
technique this is sort of important to
know if you're not happy with how well

536
00:50:59,850 --> 00:51:04,640
定义频率是如果您想指定说话并更精确地看到
defined the frequency is if you want to
specify a speak and see more precisely

537
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:15,030
更精确地指定波长您所做的是衍射已知光
specify a wavelength more precisely what
you do is you diffract off a known

538
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:27,870
晶体衍射以特定角度从已知晶体中分离出来， 
crystal diffract tract off known crystal
crystal at a particular angle and that

539
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:32,010
将会挑选出您现在感兴趣的特定波长
will pick out a particular wavelength
that you're interested in using now

540
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:34,830
每当您这样做时，您都会丢弃很多很多
whenever you're doing this you're
throwing away lots and lots and lots of

541
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,490
拥有的光子，但是如果有十到十倍的光子
the photons that you have but if you
have ten to the ten times the number of

542
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:42,090
首先需要的光子可以扔掉很多，然后您可以
photons that you need to begin with you
can throw away a ton of them and you can

543
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,870
多次衍射以真正指定该波长
diffract multiple times to really
specify that wavelength extremely

544
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:48,660
精确地进行非常高精度的测量，是的，我认为
precisely and do extremely high
precision measurements yeah I think

545
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,630
这就是我要说的，明天明天见
that's all I have to say about this I
see you tomorrow tomorrow

546
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,300
您
you
